- VS Code Version: 1.97.2 (latest)
- OS Version: Ubuntu/Windows 10

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open an `.md` file
2. Drag a folder from the left hand File Explorer and drop it into the editor while holding the SHIFT key down
3. Using the Microsoft Windows version of VSCode this action will result in the creation of a markdown style relative link in the editor **as expected**, e.g.:

```
[text](../../../folder_name)
```

4. Using the `.deb` file installed release of VSCode on Ubuntu Desktop or Linux Mint desktop, the same action results in the absolute path to the folder being pasted into the editor, e.g.:

```
/home/my_user/Documents/gitlab/doc/content/en/some/path/folder_name
```

I feel that the behaviour in the Linux distros is **incorrect and is a bug** and a markdown style link should be created instead.

I do not have any extensions installed in VSCode and all settings are in their default state (I have not changed any).

Note that I can drag an `.md` file or an image type file (`.png`, `.jpg` etc.) from a folder in the left hand explorer and drop it into the editor and on both Linux and Windows a markdown link will be created **as expected** with the relative path to the file - so I know the drag and drop facility is working as designed.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes

Steps to reproduce:

1. Click on a commit that changes multiple files in the Source Control Graph
2. Expand the files in the Multi Diff Editor. There's a large empty space at the end of a file as seen in the screenshot below marked in red.

The large space sometimes makes it hard to see the amount of files within the diff view, as the next file is at the very bottom of the screen.

*Note:* Setting `""diffEditor.hideUnchangedRegions.enabled"": false` doesn't disable the hidden lines in the Multi Diff Editor.

## Issue Description

I was following the [Electron - Building your First App](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app#optional-debugging-from-vs-code) guide to create a simple Electron app, added a debugging configuration, but was unable to run it in VSCode. It reported that it couldn't find the Node.js installed via fnm.

I can easily fix this issue by adding Node.js to the PATH, but during my investigation, I discovered a very confusing phenomenon: This issue only occurs when targeting `""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd""`. If I rename the file, everything works fine.

My experiments confirm that the `console: internalConsole` option works for files other than `electron.cmd` because it prints out a PATH that includes fnm-generated entries, proving that the PowerShell profile script was executed. 
And after removing this line, the previously working launch task now also reports that Node.js cannot be found. 
However, when targeting `electron.cmd`, the printed PATH only contains the system-configured values, without the dynamically generated profile entries.

## Steps to Reproduce
I can reproduce this behavior on a freshly installed Windows system:

1. Download and install VSCode and fnm, then run `fnm install 22`
2. Complete fnm’s [shell integration setup](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm?tab=readme-ov-file#powershell)
    ```powershell
    if (-not (Test-Path $profile)) { New-Item $profile -Force }
    echo ""fnm env --use-on-cd --shell powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression"" >> $profile
    ```

3. Verify system environment variables—Node.js should not be in PATH, but fnm should be:
    ```powershell
    $ $env:PATH
    C:\Users\<omitted>\AppData\Local\fnm_multishells\17496_1739626282534;C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7;<omitted>
    ```

4. Clone the example repo, install dependencies, and add the tutorial's launch configuration with `integratedTerminal` set:
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start.git
    cd electron-quick-start
    npm install
    mkdir .vscode
    touch .vscode/launch.json
    ```

    ```json
    {
      ""version"": ""0.2.0"",
      ""configurations"": [
        {
          ""name"": ""Main"",
          ""type"": ""node"",
          ""request"": ""launch"",
          ""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}"",
          ""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron"",
          ""windows"": {
            ""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd""
          },
          ""args"": [""."", ""--remote-debugging-port=9222""],
          ""outputCapture"": ""std"",
          ""console"": ""integratedTerminal""
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
5. Open the folder in VSCode and start debugging `Main`.

## Expected Result
An Electron window should launch and debugging should work as expected.

## Actual Result
An error popup appears with a ""Open 'launch.json'"" button in the bottom-right corner:
    ```
    Can't find Node.js binary ""<omitted>\node_modules\.bin\electron.cmd"":
    error getting version: <omitted>\node_modules\.bin\electron.cmd exited with code 1:
    '""node""' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file
    Make sure Node.js is installed and in your PATH, or set the ""runtimeExecutable"" in your launch.json
    ```

---
The most frustrating part is that this issue only affects `node_modules\.bin\electron.cmd`. If I copy the file and change nothing else, it works fine:


```powershell
$ cp node_modules\.bin\electron.cmd node_modules\.bin\electron2.cmd
$ (Get-Content .vscode\launch.json) -replace 'electron\.cmd', 'electron2.cmd' | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 output.json
$ cp output.json .vscode\launch.json
```

<details>
<summary>`.vscode\launch.json` after edit</summary>

```json
{
  ""version"": ""0.2.0"",
  ""configurations"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""Main"",
      ""type"": ""node"",
      ""request"": ""launch"",
      ""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}"",
      ""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron"",
      ""windows"": {
        ""runtimeExecutable"": ""${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron2.cmd""
      },
      ""args"": [""."", ""--remote-debugging-port=9222""],
      ""outputCapture"": ""std"",
      ""console"": ""integratedTerminal""
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

Additionally, when pressing F5 to start debugging, VSCode’s integrated terminal pops up and prints some output—this does not happen when using `electron.cmd`:
```powershell
${env:NODE_OPTIONS}=' --require ""c:/Users/<omitted>/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/resources/app/extensions/ms-vscode.js-debug/src/bootloader.js"" '; ${env:VSCODE_INSPECTOR_OPTIONS}=':::{""inspectorIpc"":""\\\\.\\pipe\\node-cdp.8392-dbb2230e-5.sock"",""deferredMode"":false,""waitForDebugger"":"""",""onlyEntrypoint"":false,""autoAttachMode"":""always"",""fileCallback"":""C:\\Users\\<omitted>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\node-debug-callback-551c913f41a77523""}'; & 'C:\Users\<omitted>\electron-quick-start/node_modules/.bin/electron2.cmd' '.' '--remote-debugging-port=9222' 
```

## Related Investigations

I found some similar issues:
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106537#issuecomment-692781598 
  Adding `""integratedTerminal""` to other configurations does help, but not for `electron.cmd`.
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/865
  Adding Node.js or fnm’s link directly to PATH solves the issue, but it doesn’t feel elegant.
    ```
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(""Path"", ""$userPath;C:\Users\<omitted>\AppData\Roaming\fnm\aliases\default"", ""User"")
    ```

Is there any hardcode strings handing around? I couldn't classify this issue as related to fnm, Node.js, Electron or any extension, maybe this is related to `internalConsole` settings, so I decided to post it under VSCode.

Hi,

I tend to use the System Context Menu because sometimes is easier to deal with the window using keyboard, instead of the mouse. But I have noticed that recently, this behavior started to occur. Not sure if there is some setting to change.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Be sure the _sticky scroll_ behavior is ON
2. Open a document which will display the _sticky scroll_
3. Scroll the document until the _sticky scroll_ is visible
4. Put the mouse over the _sticky scroll_
5. Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open the System Context Menu
6. Instead of the System Context Menu, you will see this menu

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97bf23ad-795e-4588-bc58-6e1a0f22f6d8)

7. Move the mouse out of the _sticky scroll_, inside the editor text area
8. Hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> again
9. Now, the System Context Menu appears

You will notice the same erroneous behavior if you the mouse cursor is over the editor title area, or the window title bar.

Thank you

16,microsoft/vscode,Suggestion: add validation for missing properties under `contributes` in `package.json` for a VS Code extension,"You can use this repo for reference: https://github.com/mohsen1/llm-debugger-vscode-extension

In `package.json` for this extension, the `icon` properties are missing for `viewContainers` and `views` that it contributes. When you run the extension, you get the following error message:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5634d8c-f579-4779-9888-55f1b02f201d)

I probably spent an hour trying to ""fix"" the top level `icon` property in `package.json` to no avail since it wasn't the culprit :).  It wasn't until @isidorn pointed out to me that these contributions also needed an `icon` property. You can see the ""fix"" here:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed3bbd15-97ea-4284-992b-8b94f018f78a)

Suggestion: Can we show validation on one or more of the `contributes` properties in the file, similar to how there is validation on `activationEvents` `""*""` that give the user some indication of where the missing properties are?  

Assigning per Isi's recommendation.","['bug', 'workbench-views']",2025-02-13T19:42:11Z,1,2,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/240707,Dependency Issue

18,microsoft/vscode,Wrong encoding of JSON schema URL,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I configured a JSON schema in the json.schemas settings element:
{
  ""fileMatch"": [""associations.config*.json""],
  ""url"": ""file:///c:/ELOprofessional/config/json-schema/associations.config.schema.json""
}
This works well.
I replaced the ""url"" paramter with the following:
{
  ""fileMatch"": [""associations.config*.json""],
  ""url"": ""https://ikmaster.ovitashu.local:9093/ix-elo/ix?cmd\\=readdoc1&downloadid=(9CF9004A-DC3C-746A-97F5-7960CF3BDE0D)&fname=associations.config.schema.json""
}
The URL is correct above, I can open it in a browser. However VS cannot open it, I got the following error message in the terminal:

Unable to load schema from 'https://ikmaster.ovitashu.local:9093/ix-elo/ix?cmd\=readdoc1&downloadid=(9CF9004A-DC3C-746A-97F5-7960CF3BDE0D)&fname=associations.config.schema.json': Not Found. The requested location could not be found.

I checked at the server side and the problem is that VS sends bad URL, it encodes the = and & characters, which is a problem, because these are important separator characters of the GET parameters.

This is the URL that VS sends (Tomcat localhost access LOG file):

192.168.190.64 - - [13/Feb/2025:08:21:56 +0100] ""GET /ix-elo/ix?cmd%3Dreaddoc1%26downloadid%3D%289CF9004A-DC3C-746A-97F5-7960CF3BDE0D%29%26fname%3Dassociations.config.schema.json HTTP/1.1"" 404 121

And this is the how it looks like when I open it from a browser:

192.168.190.64 - - [13/Feb/2025:08:21:44 +0100] ""GET /ix-elo/ix?cmd=readdoc1&downloadid=(9CF9004A-DC3C-746A-97F5-7960CF3BDE0D)&fname=associations.config.schema.json HTTP/1.1"" 200 79828

So, it seems clearly for me as a bug.
Thank you for your help!

Kind regards,
Csaba D.

20,microsoft/vscode,Editor setting `editor.tabSize` does not apply on empty files after startup,"Steps to Reproduce:

1. create a new empty `foo.yml` file and open it
2. notice how in the status bar you can see `Spaces: 2`
3. reload window

?? status bar indicates `Spaces: 4`

This is a variant of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/231224 where it seems that since ESM, certain configuration defaults are not present at the time we create a model. My fix in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/dccf6bb5eca1d3bf9530436f67c25c462d1634d3 ensures that we pass forward the proper `editor.tabSize` to `updateOptions`, but it seems to be one of the few options we do not support to change ad-hoc here:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/093e289792001a7ce53893e5944bc1d9dfb0e11a/src/vs/editor/browser/config/editorConfiguration.ts#L337-L347

Specifically, there is no `editor.tabSize` in [`EditorOption`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/093e289792001a7ce53893e5944bc1d9dfb0e11a/src/vs/editor/common/config/editorOptions.ts#L5432).

Rather, these seem to be read only when creating the model:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/093e289792001a7ce53893e5944bc1d9dfb0e11a/src/vs/editor/common/services/modelService.ts#L122

I am not sure if this can be fixed at all in editor land, thus also assigning @sandy081 to determine if extension config defaults could be resolved sooner, though I would not do that at the price of a slower startup to be fair.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

This issue occurs even when all the extensions are disabled (i checked) but I will leave the extension info available.

1. Make a git repo.
2. Make some commits on master
3. checkout a different branch
4. make some commits there
5. open the source control graph and inspect

The graph used to show the currently checked out branch's commits for both local and remote, as well as the `remote/master`. This is useful when you want to rebase or pull, because you have an idea about the state of your branch (leading / trailing) as compared to the `master` branch.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccd7ec98-d2fe-42e8-a3e8-ea7baef55545)

This information is no longer present. I only see the `local` / `remote` information for the currently checked out branch, but no reference for the `origin/master`

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2185d64f-7c6c-4ada-84ce-c39e78716d36)

You wouldn't be able to tell, but the `demo` branch is 6 commits behind and 5 commits ahead of the `master` branch in this picture.

22,microsoft/vscode,My Code Insiders build doesn't work well with VS Code Neovim extension,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

After a while using - it may just be one key press - all keyboard is grabbed and not registered in the editor.

I suspect the issue may be with this fix https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/ff39acb25de7a6c261e817f7c3da36bf9ebf7f79

I was trying to use insiders, because of this or similar bug: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/238618

In my case navigating with vim movments up/down (j,k) for a second, takes me up to the first line and starts placing ""jjjjjjjjjj"" string inside with additional text "" om: message"" on the top, so it was like ""om: message jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj""  inside the first or second line of the file. I think the bug is related to timing, maybe I have too many extensions and code base is large. While the linter or static code analyzer is processesing context, it grabs the actions performed by the vscode extensions and breaks the expected behavior.

- VS Code Version: 1.97.1
- OS Version: Windows 11 Enterprise, Version 23H2

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to Azure Resource Extension
2. Sign In to Azure
3. Click Allow on the, ""The extension 'Azure Resources' wants to sign in using Microsoft"" pop-up
4. Sign in pop-up shows work account linked to windows.  I select ""Use another account""
5. I enter 2nd work account username
6. I am automatically routed to Microsoft Authenticator for the work account linked to windows

I am not able to sign in using my 2nd work account.  This is important as that is the account with the Azure resources I need.

Resolved by:
1. Going to VS Code settings, searching for microsoft-authentication.implementation
2. Set to ""classic""
3. When signing in to Azure, the browser opens and I'm allowed to select my 2nd work account and log into that

NOTE:  I had to change my browser default to Edge as Chrome did the same thing as the issue.


This was NOT a problem a week ago.  I would like to know, 1) why this is happening, and 2) that you PLEASE don't remove the classic authentication method until it is resolved!

25,microsoft/vscode,`IConfigurationChangeEvent.affectsConfiguration` does not support `overrides` properly for default changes,"Extracted from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/231224

At some point after startup, configuration defaults will change from extensions such as `markdown`. Specifically, the markdown extension contributes defaults for a `[markdown]` language override.

The editor listens to config changes, but tries to be clever to not update too often by using:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/21525b01bf68bf9250cb856f192628fffc449234/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/textEditor.ts#L111-L113

This eventually ends up in this method with the override properly set as `markdown`:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/21525b01bf68bf9250cb856f192628fffc449234/src/vs/platform/configuration/common/configurationModels.ts#L1200

However, we end up in an early return from here:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/21525b01bf68bf9250cb856f192628fffc449234/src/vs/platform/configuration/common/configurationModels.ts#L1207

I conclude, that the configuration event does not properly support `affectsConfiguration` calls with a language override.

Or am I using this method in the wrong way?","['bug', 'config']",2025-02-11T18:36:14Z,1,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/240410,Logical Bug

- [x] Notebooks (.ipynb files)
- [ ] Interactive Window and\/or Cell Scripts (.py files with \#%% markers)

### What happened?

After searching for a term und shifting focus to the cell / text field the window position jumps. It's actually pretty annoying :)

I could reproduce the bug in a clean installation of VS Code:
- install Jupyter extension.
- create new .ipynb-file.
- create code cell.
- add random text in with way more lines than window displays, e.g. 200.
- search a term that exists at least 2 times in different sections of the cell (so when going to the next occurrence it needs to scroll).
- click a couple of times the up and down arrow (optimally over the beginning of the findings e.g. from 3/3 to 1/3)
- scroll one click with mouse wheel in the text field / cell up- or downwards.
=> the window jumps way more lines than one mouse wheel click.

The size of jumps changes with text size I assume.

32,microsoft/vscode,Can't sign into Azure from VS Code with the new authentication. VPN blocking native auth flow,"I need to sign in to Azure from browser for my company VPN to work properly. I was using browser sign-in page until a couple of weeks.

When I needed to login a couple of days ago I tried as usual but VSCode now opens azure login in a internal view / internal window. I can't sign into my company VPN account this way.

I believe this is because of the new Microsoft authentication method.

Using Azure CLI in a terminal to login doesn't integrate with the azure extensions, and the only way for me now to work is using the classic Microsoft authentication and I can't rely on that because it's going to disappear in the future.

Is there any way to force a ""browser login"" or login with device code with the new authentication method? If not, could it be added before removing the ""classic"" option?","['bug', 'upstream', 'microsoft-authentication']",2025-02-10T21:25:21Z,11,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/240304,Dependency Issue

It seems it gets stuck when matches in markdown cells, and the markdown cells are not switched to editing mode.

37,microsoft/vscode,"SCM - Binary File Diff does not show in Combined Working Diff, Combined Staged Diff or Commit Diff","### Correct observation:

Binary Files show as added, renamed, changed or deleted in the working tree diff and the staged diff if each individual binary file is _**viewed separately.**_

<img width=""589"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8413b29-9ae4-4bcb-ac23-63d943e62977"" />

### Incorrect observation and Problem:

Binary Files do not show **at all** in the combined working tree diff, combined staged changes diff or in the commit diff. If such a diff has **_only_** binary file changes, the diff shows ""No Changed Files"" which is incorrect and misleading.

<img width=""621"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ce233ba-03b5-430b-9c7c-cdfd0d9dadc0"" />

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Add, rename, change or delete a binary file (such as an image).
2. View the working tree changes as a combined diff by clicking ""Open Changes"" button in ""Source Control"" pane.
3. Stage the changes.
4. View the staged changes as a combined diff by clicking ""Open Staged Changes"" button in ""Source Control"" pane.
5. Commit the changes.
6. View the diff of the commit by clicking on it in the ""Source Control Graph"" pane.

**Note:** Steps 2, 4 and 6 show the same problem in various states.

### Additional information:

**Sample Repository to test with:** https://github.com/ADTC/vscode-binary-diff-sample-repo/commits/main/ 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ADTC/vscode-binary-diff-sample-repo.git
cd vscode-binary-diff-sample-repo
code .
```

Tip: [You can grab some sample images here.](https://github.com/yavuzceliker/sample-images/tree/main/images)

**Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?:** Yes (I confirm that I tried it with `code --disable-extensions` and the problem persists.)

Hi,

I was organizing my profiles, between Stable and Insiders release installations, and when I tried to import one to another, the Import process wasn't actually finishing, resulting in an loop experience.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Export a profile from VS Code Insiders
2. Import a profile to VS Code
3. Click `Create`
4. You can see the progress / toast saying it is _installing extensions..._
5. The progress / toast finishes
6. The `Create` button remains enabled and the _unsaved profile_ indicators also remains there.

<img width=""1169"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed525ede-21bf-4f37-8575-e703c3e6a146"" />

8. Click to close the profile and a modal window (to save profile changes) is show, even without changing anything after importing the profile

<img width=""277"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b2a6c61-d534-4359-bb3e-ba3e063ec6b3"" />

10. Click `save`
11. The same progress / toast appears, installing extensions for the profile
12. The progress / toast finishes

46,microsoft/vscode,WATCH Unexpected COPY / PASTE behaviour,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I'm using the build in debugger for python in visual studio code.
For years I'm able to CTRL + C the expression from the WATCH stack.

Since the last update. it doesn't copy the expression,... but it copies the value.
When right clicking on the expression, there is no option to copy the expression. Only to copy the value.

What I would like to see, is CTRL + C copies the expression. Right click > Copy Value, would copy the value of the expression.

- VS Code Version: 1.97.0 (I don't think this is a regression.)
- OS Version: Linux.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open an integrated terminal.
2. Move terminal into editor area.
3. Run a continuously running program. For a simple example, just run `node` to launch a REPL.
4. Terminal in editor tab shows as below:  
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99f66e69-eacb-4e04-ac8b-b869f75f7fcc)

Editor tab won't substitute the `$(loading~spin)` variable with actual spin, so this variable should be removed when moving a terminal into editor area. Or, let editor tab support rendering a spin.

We should add a tab index of 0 so users can discover this.

53,microsoft/vscode,VScode auto detects HTML/JS as Dart on unsaved files,"I'm on Windows 11, latest VScode version, I don't write flutter or dart, therefore I don't have any flutter or Dart extensions.

### Steps to reproduce
Open an empty file, don't save it on disk. paste any HTML snippet containing Javascript like this one

```
<script>
  let countdownInterval;

  // Start or restart the countdown with `seconds` total time
  function startCountdown(seconds) {
    // Clear any existing interval
    if (countdownInterval) {
      clearInterval(countdownInterval);
    }

    // Show the countdown container
    const countdownEl = document.getElementById('countdown');
    countdownEl.style.display = 'block';

    // Reset and trigger the bar animation
    const bar = countdownEl.querySelector('.countdown-bar');
    bar.classList.remove('animate');
    bar.style.setProperty('--duration', `${seconds}s`);
    void bar.offsetWidth;  // Force reflow to restart the animation
    bar.classList.add('animate');

    // Update the text label
    const label = document.getElementById('countdown-label');
    let timeLeft = seconds;
    label.textContent = formatTime(timeLeft);

    // Decrement every second
    countdownInterval = setInterval(() => {
      timeLeft -= 1;
      label.textContent = formatTime(timeLeft);

      if (timeLeft <= 0) {
        clearInterval(countdownInterval);
        label.textContent = 'Completed!';
      }
    }, 1000);
  }

  // Simple helper to format seconds (customize as you wish)
  function formatTime(sec) {
    return sec + 's remaining';
    // Or if you prefer mm:ss:
    // const m = Math.floor(sec / 60);
    // const s = sec % 60;
    // return `${m}:${s.toString().padStart(2, '0')} remaining`;
  }

  // Example: if you're using htmx for SSE
  // (in your SSE definition, set `event: ""#progress""`)
  document.body.addEventListener('htmx:sseMessage', function (evt) {
    // The SSE message data is available in evt.detail.data
    // We'll regex to find <time>...</time>
    if (evt.detail && evt.detail.data) {
      const match = evt.detail.data.match(/<time>(\d+)<\/time>/);
      if (match) {
        // If the time is given in minutes, multiply by 60
        // If the time is already in seconds, pass it directly
        const minutes = parseInt(match[1], 10);
        const seconds = minutes * 60;  
        startCountdown(seconds);
      }
    }
  });
</script>

```


On my Vscode as soon as you paste this snippet, it's detected as Dart, sometimes I get linting errors too.

I don't know if this bug can be fixed or not, you know more, language detection is hard, especially when you mix HTML and CSS and JS I would guess. 

If this can be fixed, great, if not then I would suggest allowing the user to turn off auto language detection for a particular language. For example I don't do Flutter or Dart, I have a feeling that if I can just turn off Dart language detection, the system would recognize the file correctly as javascript, it's just that Dart has a higher probability now.

Besides, I only write a few languages, if I can either disable the languages I don't use and are supported by VSCode or enable only the language I do use (Blacklist/Whitelist). This could improve the performance of the editor, maybe? I don't know

Another solution, is if the editor is not 100% of the file type, then let the file open in plain text, at least then the user won't see any linting errors and such. Plain text is fine and that's because if you're opening a temporary file to check some code, you don't need any highlighting or linting but if the file is not detected correctly, then often all you see are errors. Especially if you're using inline error extension like [error lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) and most people are using such extensions these days.","['bug', 'languages-guessing']",2025-02-07T19:35:13Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/239991,Syntax Error

5. Click Add Configuration... button in the bottom on json editor (for folder b)

Actual behavior:

The editor for folder b launch.json closes. The new editor open containing lauch.json for folder a! Drop down appears.

Expected behavior:

Add launch config to file which is open! Not the other file
If its not possible to figure which file is currently open - it should not even provide the button, its super confusing

    },
    ""files.associations"": {
        ""*.h"": ""c""

When viewing the diff of a file encoded in **Windows-1252**, the diff view incorrectly highlights differences on lines containing special characters, even though no actual changes exist in the PR.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca90db4-1954-481e-9dc1-5d353e9cd817)

However, when using **GitLens Compare**, the same lines are not marked as different and are correctly displayed as unchanged.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb2d974d-1434-46b1-a6a3-f09f40937f93)

This makes reviewing a PR that modifies Windows-1252 encoded files very difficult, as many unrelated changes will appear in the diff view.

Steps to Reproduce:
Prerequisite: Text Editor > Hover: Enabled is disabled in the settings

When calling a hint with quick information (CTRL+Q with Intellij Keybindings, or CTRL+K CTRL+I), it used to be possible to press ESC immediately to hide the hint. In versions older than 1.95.3, you must first select this prompt with the mouse, after which you can hide it by ESC.

The latest version where this problem does not exist is 1.95.3.

If you enable Text Editor > Hover: Enabled, the function works as expected: the hint is displayed in manual mode and it is hidden by ESC.

- see overlap of line numbers w/ code

- sometimes the editor reacts and shifts code to the right, however if you undo the line numbers, it remains stuck out right and has a huge margin of empty space left. 
- can get into a state where some lines shift with the line numbers and some don't
- seems like decorations are rendered according to non-line#'d positions, can find yourself in a state where symbol highlighting seems very out of place

- VS Code Version:   1.94.2 1.95.3 1.96.4 at least, but not earlier
- OS Version: Fedora 39, Kernel 6.11.4, also Fedora 40, Kernel 6.11.6

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a file, for example with a bash command  ""date >x""
2. Open vscode, make a new text file, 
3. Do a ""save as"" and try to save to x
4. Note that it saved to x, without any warning that x exists.

Perhaps it is something I have misconfigured, but it does not happen in earlier versions of vscode, and it happens with no extensions turned on.    It seems weird no one has reported this, so it makes me wonder, but it sure seems like a bug. 

ETA: Tried on a newer Fedora, same result with 1.96.4.   ","['bug', 'linux', 'confirmation-pending', 'native-file-dialog']",2025-02-02T23:45:48Z,1,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/239448,UI/UX Bug
81,microsoft/vscode,Inconsistent and confusing display of newlines in file paths,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use Linux
2. Create a new directory
3. Open the directory in VS code
4. With a terminal in the newly created directory, create a new file with a newline in its name. For example with `touch 'newline_<ENTER>file.txt'`.
5. Look at the file in Explorer. It will show as `newline_`. The remainder of the name is hidden.
6. Hover over the file in Explorer. It will now show the full file name over two lines.
7. Open the file in Explorer by clicking at it once. It will now display as `newline_file.txt` in the tab view at the top. That is, there is no indication that there's a newline in there.
8. Hover over the file name tab. Ensure that the file doesn't have the ""Keep open"" property, i.e. the title in the tab needs to be cursive. It will show its name over three lines for some reason, as:
  ```txt
  path/to/file/newline_

  file.txt
  ```

Expected behavior:

  - Consistent behavior
  - File names with newlines are not cut off
  - No double newline when showing a file name with one newline
  - Perhaps that file names would always show on one line, for simplicity. With some special indicator to show that it's a newline there.

This may seem like a weird use case, and it kind of is, but I was writing test code to see if my application would behave weirdly with file paths with newlines and I noticed that VS code did, perhaps unsurprisingly.

2. vscode remote calls ""code-<hash>""
3. this binary panics

```

You can't have it both ways, if you decide for whatever reason to link openssl statically like it currently is in the ""code"" executable you MUST NOT attempt to load the operating system configuration openssl.cnf or similar. it might not be compatible, 
I cannot find where to exactly override the environment just for this binary , it is sufficient to setenv OPENSSL_CONF=/dev/null to make the issue go away. ","['bug', 'code-cli']",2025-01-31T22:33:20Z,1,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/239382,UI/UX Bug

92,microsoft/vscode,Long descriptions in merge editor can push the action items off the screen.,"- VS Code Version: insiders.vscode.dev
- OS Version: Linux

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run the `_open.mergeEditor` command with args like:
```json
""base"": ""file:///vscode/README.md"",
""input1"": {
    ""title"": ""Lefty left"",
    ""description"": ""Very, very long and boring description"",
    ""uri"": ""file:///vscode/README.md"",
},
""input2"": {
    ""title"": ""Righty right"",
    ""description"": ""Very, very long and boring description"",
    ""uri"": ""file:///vscode/README.md"",
},
""output"": ""file:///vscode/README.md""
```
2. Scale or in some other way make on of the columns small.


As the editor header gets smaller, the title, desctiption and toolbar all refuse the shrink `flex-shrink: 0`, and as such the actions get pushed off the screen:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85c0b6e3-1d91-4802-bf81-810f989da4b9)

Full screenshot:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3284ea-812f-408d-ad96-0e65f09e9f00)

If you shrink the view any further, then the actions are not visible at all.


---


I think that the actions should always be visible. What is interesting is that in the results header at the button, which has more space by default, `.description` is allowed to shrink.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/db8e3d291301dbde1c40221203e5e4255d9fdbec/src/vs/workbench/contrib/mergeEditor/browser/view/media/mergeEditor.css#L36

But a few lines up for non result editors, it is not allowed to shrink.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/db8e3d291301dbde1c40221203e5e4255d9fdbec/src/vs/workbench/contrib/mergeEditor/browser/view/media/mergeEditor.css#L27


There is also `.detail` and `.title` which are never allowed to shrink.


A small work around would be to allow `.description` to shrink. I think that is the most common field to contain longer descriptions.

Another option would be to nest the three text fields in a child element as a sibling to .toolbar. Then we can control how they grow/shrink relative to each other, but force the parent contrainer to shrink to make space for the actions.


---


The real word issue that we see with this is that we are trying to use the description field in a merge control to show the short first line commit messages to help users see exactly what which side of the conflict is. We are happy for these messages to be cut short, but what is currently happening is that the long messages are pushing the action off the screen.","['bug', 'merge-editor']",2025-01-30T20:27:33Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/239256,UI/UX Bug
93,microsoft/vscode,Visual Studio Code doesn't show translated walkthrough strings until restarting app or reloading window,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Select ""Configure Display Language"" from comand palette and choose e.g. ""spanish (es)""
2. Restart application
Observe that application menus and UI is in spanish as selected
3. Go to extension marketplace and install a localized extension, e.g. ms-vscode.cpptools [defined in this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/tree/main/Extension)
4. Open extension walkthrough in welcome page. 
Walkthrough steps will be in english and not spanish, although markdown content in side-panel will in fact be in spanish.
5. select ""Developer: Reload Window"" from comand palette
Walkthrough steps will now be in spanish, as expected

I'm using version 1.96.4, but this same issue repros in latest insider build.

94,microsoft/vscode,Terminal resizing/repainting issue when using Zellij,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I use Zellij to maintain persistent sessions for my Remote-SSH connections to a Linux host from a Windows laptop.

I filed https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/3568 thinking it was a Zellij issue, but according to the developer it might be an issue with how VSCode triggers SIGWINCH and sets TIOCSWINSZ.

I have added a comment with a couple of screenshots to show how using CTRL+B (which should resize the terminal) only does so partially.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install GitHub Copilot extension in VSCode Insiders
2. Open any file
3. Open inline chat
4. Ask something

There should be `Discard` button (unless it has been removed intentionally).
In stable version it's displayed correctly.

~Also it looks like that code block is not formatted.~ - It seems that it has been fixed in new released version (Commit: 63c0355e5bc04b124b8600ce42fe30c73b7a5a5e) but unfortunately `Discard` button is still not displayed.

Screenshot below, left 1.97.0-insider, right stable version 1.96.4

Version: 1.96.3 (user setup)

The order of configuration items in an extension's settings is not respected when a search is done in the settings panel.

In the table of contents in Settings, if you click on an extension (or expand the extension and choose one of its setting's categories), then the order will be correct. However, if you do a search for the extension name, then the settings are shown in the incorrect order. In this scenario they aren't even shown in proper lexicographic (alphabetical) order.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open settings
2. Search for the name of an extension
3. Observe that the order of the configuration items is not the same as as the order you would see if you DID NOT search, and had simply clicked on the extension name in the table of contents,. When searching, the order does not follow what is defined in the extension's package.json file.

In the screenshots, the name of the extension is ""AtomicViz"" and the search is done for the string ""atomicviz"". So the search results should be properly ordered.

- VS Code Version: 1.96.4
- OS Version: Windows 11

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a code change in a reasonably long file, in a language that has inlay hints, so there's a diff
2. Open the diff viewer, ensure word wrap is enabled (<kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd>), and scroll around throughout the file
3. Watch as the lines get misaligned between the added and removed side
4. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd> (with `editor.inlayHints.enabled` set to `onUnlessPressed`) to temporarily hide the inlays and notice how they also get misaligned

Video of the bug in action:

[Video (70 seconds)](https://files.keavon.com/-/HarshAcclaimedEuropeanfiresalamander/capture_40_.mp4), showing both the scrolling-caused misalignment and triggering it with toggling inlays.

Description:

This is an issue that has frustrated my many times a day for years, so I'm finally filling an issue for it.

The diff editor is meant to keep your left (removals) and right (additions) side's lines aligned. But scrolling throughout the code file, or turning on/off inlay hints, causes a misalignment to occur and persist. The result is that the red removals and green additions for a line can be considerably misaligned.

This happens under the conditions that word wrap is enabled (so a line of code may wrap across multiple displayed lines on the left, right, or both sides) and inlays are enabled (so the width of a line of code may become elongated).

My theory is that scrolling within the document causes the LSP to generate more inlays within the newly viewed areas, changing the line widths which changes the wrapping which changes the number of wrapped lines occupied by one line of code; and it does so differently on the right from the left, since the LSP generates no inlays for the left side.

The workaround for this is to either type something to make it recalculate, or briefly toggle word wrap by tapping <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd> twice. But a proper fix for this bug would be a real quality of life improvement.","['bug', 'diff-editor']",2025-01-24T21:30:01Z,2,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/238724,UI/UX Bug

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  open any project in VSC
2. navigate to the file explorer using ? ? E (Command shift E)
3. navigate to the folder you want the file to be created in using arrow keys ? ? ? to collapse folder, ? to expand folder
4. when the folder is selected press ? F10 (default context menu for macbook) the menu appears

5. using arrows, select create folder, or create file and click enter
6. observe it will start renaming the folder in both cases, it doesn't matter if the folder is expanded or collapsed

Whereas if I'm using the physical mouse to to the same, it start the interaction correctly (unless you hadn't focussed the VSC, which causes the interaction to be buggy, but in this case it is not that)

I discovered this as part of https://github.com/dprint/dprint-vscode/pull/99; for months my editor has been unresponsive at startup, unable to hover or even copy and paste now that there are paste providers, and this particular call is the culprit.

If I run Node directly, or call VS Code ""as node"", it does not exhibit these problems. My impression is that this has to do with VS Code patching all of the networking calls, since unfortunately `getReport` calls to the network (even though effectively all users use it to check if libc is musl or not).

120,microsoft/vscode,"Debugger shows incorrect thread state if ""continued"" arrives too soon after a ""stopped"" (or ""started""?)","I had a bug raised against Dart where the debugger shows threads as ""paused on entry"" when they should not be. The DAP traffic looks good:

```
// Start
[5:17:21 PM] [DAP] [Info] <== {""seq"":21,""type"":""event"",""body"":{""reason"":""started"",""threadId"":3},""event"":""thread""}
// Pause
[5:17:21 PM] [DAP] [Info] <== {""seq"":43,""type"":""event"",""body"":{""allThreadsStopped"":false,""reason"":""entry"",""threadId"":3},""event"":""stopped""}
// Resume
[5:17:21 PM] [DAP] [Info] <== {""seq"":78,""type"":""event"",""body"":{""allThreadsContinued"":false,""threadId"":3},""event"":""continued""}
```

Yet the UI shows the thread as paused. I was able to reproduce this in MockDebug. It seems to only occur when the events occur close together (if I add delays, it doesn't seem to happen):

```ts
// Start additional threads, pause on entry, continue.
for (var i = 2; i < 5; i++) {
	this._threads.push(new Thread(i, `Thread ${i}`));
	this.sendEvent(new ThreadEvent('started', i));
	this.sendEvent(new OutputEvent(`Thread ${i} started\n`));
	this.sendEvent(new StoppedEvent('entry', i));
	this.sendEvent(new OutputEvent(`Thread ${i} stopped on entry\n`));
	// await this.delay(1); // Uncomment this to fix it
	this.sendEvent(new ContinuedEvent(i, false));
	this.sendEvent(new OutputEvent(`Thread ${i} continued\n`));
}
```

Full repro is here:

https://github.com/DanTup/vscode-mock-debug/tree/repro-dart-code-5397 / https://github.com/DanTup/vscode-mock-debug/commit/04f4764e853cbee2b09ca28c110c423fb4b99fd0

This felt a bit like https://github.com/microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/513 to me, but that actually turned out to be caused by `allThreadsStopped` defaulting to `true`. I don't believe that's the case here because in the real project where this happens (Dart debugger), we set both `allThreadsStopped` and `allThreadsContinued` to `false` (though I haven't set `allThreadsContinued` in the MockDebug example because it doesn't seem to be available in the constructor... I don't believe that's the issue though as `allThreadsContinued` seems to default to false and the delay shouldn't fix the issue in that case).","['bug', 'debug']",2025-01-23T17:35:56Z,0,7,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/238591,Logical Bug

- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.22631

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open an empty folder with nothing inside
2. Disable all extensions
3. Add a new `file.dart` file
4. Write the following to it:

```dart
var myString = '''
Here is a string with ()
and some other examples {like (this)}.
''';
```

5. See the braces colouring (possibly, more on that later)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87fbf68b-4dbb-43b0-bbba-f070e35ceab5)

6. Change the string to be raw by adding `r` before the opening `'''`:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70b8bbc-ad07-43a8-8eee-a2216a434a4f)

I've asked @DanTup to verify this but with the same VS Code version he could not see this behaviour on his machine. 

If I close the editor (file opened) and reopen it (even removing `r` now) I see the braces colouring flash and go back to string colour.

His guess is that there may be some other racing here as https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230498. Same machine, a Samsung Galaxy Book Pro. To note we had problems with this colouring previously at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/209435 for Dart and we still have this opened for Python https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/225179.

I can't reliably reproduce this (besides flashing) again on this _exact_ folder/file (unfortunatelly). But I saw this behaviour previously on Dart projects and this is an empty folder with only that file inside.","['bug', 'bracket-pair-colorization']",2025-01-23T12:44:35Z,3,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/238564,UI/UX Bug

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Arch linux with wayland (hyprland compositor)
2. Hover/click the file menu
2. All windows crash

This looks very similar to the issue discussed at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230604

But at least for me, I'm on latest versions and made sure that the recommended workaroudn of removing meta/super key from the keybind is applied, still - vscode crashes for me.

Still happens if I launch with `code --disable-extensions`

If I downgrade to 1.94.0 it no longer crashes but I cannot use extensions such as GH copilot.

- OS Version: Windows 11 24H2

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Have an extension with the following code be run on github.dev:
```ts
// copy `lib` folder from `assets/initial-project` from extension files to the root of current workspace

const initDir = vscode.Uri.joinPath(
    context.extensionUri,
    ""assets/initial-project""
);

const workspaceUri = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders?.[0]?.uri!;

await vscode.workspace.fs.copy(
    vscode.Uri.joinPath(initDir, ""lib""),
    vscode.Uri.joinPath(workspaceUri, ""lib"")
);
```
2. The file gets created with json listing of folder's contents.

NOTE: The folder is copied properly when run on VSCode desktop and vscode.dev with local filesystem.

Here is the [URL of the folder](https://glebbash.vscode-unpkg.net/glebbash/lo/0.0.57/extension/assets/initial-project/lib) from my extension, I guess the fix is to somehow detect that this is a folder and not a file in github.dev file system provider.

```

However, when I open the file in the merge editor, there are 3 conflicts.

2 of the 3 conflicts are missing buttons to accept changes, making it seemingly impossible to resolve the conflict.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install a formatter that takes a significant amount of time for large files (for example [YAPF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eeyore.yapf) for Python). Note while this might require the installation of an extension, the bug is still located within the code of VS Code. With a large enough file, you can probably reproduce this with VS Code's built-in formatters as well.
2. Set `""editor.formatOnSave"": true` in the settings of VS Code.
3. Open a large file so that formatting takes long enough (for YAPF, any Python file with more than 1000 lines will do).
4. Make some changes to the file make the file unformatted.
5. Save.
6. Wait until the `Saving '[...]': Running Code Actions and Formatters...` message is displayed in the status bar and the `Running '[...]' Formatter` notification is shown.
7. Before the formatter finishes and VS Code saves the formatted file, do any of the following:
   * Click anywhere in the editor so that the position of the caret is changed.
   * Press any of the four arrow keys.
   * Change the active file in the editor by clicking on another editor tab.

## Expected Behavior

The file is formatted and saved as soon as the formatter finishes.

## Actual Behavior

The file is neither formatted nor saved, even if waiting long enough. This is also indicated by the status bar message and notification immediately vanishing when performing any of the actions in step 7 above.

I even tried pressing `shift` when dragging the file, but I still cannot catch the event.
I found some similar issues, such as #182449 and #218626, but none of them helped me.

## Title:
Tooltip for Close Button in Dialog Box is Obscured by the Dialog Itself

This issue affects the usability of the dialog box, as users cannot see the tooltip for the close button, which may lead to confusion or difficulty in closing the dialog.

## Steps to Reproduce:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ed6c046-095f-4cbd-af74-bd2e4d442393)

<img width=""146"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/266c2b55-76d9-42c0-b9a3-a68bfa31b11e"" />

1. Perform an action in VS Code that triggers a dialog box to appear.
2. Hover the mouse over the close button (typically the 'X' in the top-right corner) of the dialog box.
3. Observe that the tooltip for the close button is displayed but is obscured by the dialog box itself.

## Expected Behavior:
The tooltip should be displayed above or outside the dialog box, ensuring it is fully visible to the user.

## Actual Behavior:
The tooltip is rendered behind the dialog box, making it partially or completely invisible.

## Additional Information:
- **Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?**: Yes

I also conducted tests using the latest codebase of the VS Code project, and the aforementioned bug can be reproduced as well.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

I'm using Miniconda to manage my Python Virtual Environments, each time i open a Terminal (powershell), i have junk ansi text written after the virtual environnement selected. It has begun some days ago.
I have reinstalled VSCode insiders, and all the extensions (from bare metal), and same issue each time. Same issue on all of my virtual env
Step to reproduce : 
1. Create an conda vistual environment
2. Open a Python project (folder)
3. Select the virtual environment
4. Open a  powershell Terminal (CTRL+SHIFT+P) from the palette (Create new terminal) 
5. Terminal is opened with the right Virtual Environment selected
6. Hit Enter (or any command)
7. Junk  (it seems it comes from some profile info) is displayed between the (Virtual Env) and the prompt >

=> No problem if i open a cmd terminal

142,microsoft/vscode,Luminosity contrast ratio of keyboard focus indicator on Authorize button fails to meet the required ratio of 3:1: A11y_VS Code extension for API Center_Generate HTTP file_Authorize_Non Text Contrast.,"### GitHub Tags
#A11yTCS; #A11ySev2; #Win32; #WCAG1.4.11; #GH_VSCodeextensionforAPICenter_Win32_Apr2024; #DesktopApp; #Visual Studio Code Client; #A11yMAS; #NonText Contrast; #A11YWCAG2.1; 

### Environment Details:
Application Name: VS Code Extension for API Center
OS: Windows 11 Enterprise 23H2 (OS build 22631.3296)

### Repro Steps:

1. Create an API center in azure portal.
2. Open Visual studio Code.
3. Tab till API center extension in the left side panel and press enter.
4. Tab till definition under the Api name which you have created, and press enter.
5. The name which you have provided to the definition will appear for ex-""openapi4"", right click on it.
6. Go to ""Generate HTTP file"" using the down arrow and press enter.
7. An HTTP file will appear.
8. Tab till Authorize button.
9. Verify whether the Luminosity contrast ratio of keyboard focus indicator on Authorize button meet the required ratio of 3:1 or not.

### Actual Result:
Luminosity contrast ratio of keyboard focus indicator on Authorize button fails to meet the required ratio of 3:1
Note: This issue is observed throughout the feature.

### Expected Result:
Luminosity contrast ratio of visual focus indicator on authorize button should be greater than or equal to required ratio of 3:1.

### User Impact:
People with low vision often have difficulty perceiving tab focus that have insufficient contrast if Luminosity contrast ratio of visual focus indicator fails to meet the required ratio of 3:1. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a lightness difference of 3:1 or greater can make these items more distinguishable when the person does not see a full range of colors

143,microsoft/vscode,Git - VS Code's git commit error pop-up shows wrong hook failure,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Description:
It seems when performing a git commit from the VS Code UI and there is a commit failure (e.x., in a git-hook) the error pop-up only shows only the first line of the output which is not necessarily the error.

Steps to Reproduce:
Perform a git commit from the VS Code UI so that you get a warning followed by an error. I'd expect to see the error message in the pop-up but instead the unrelated warning message shows which can be misleading.

Steps to Reproduce (Specific):
1. `lint-stages` issuing a warning ""No staged files match any configured task"" (which passes gracefully)
2. then there is an error from `commitlint` about a bad commit message.

More Details:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad257a07-9a2a-4892-bdc8-49a5ad074be2)
raw commit output:
```
filepath> git commit -m ""foo: this will fail""
? No staged files match any configured task.
?   input: foo: this will fail
?   type must be one of [build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test] [type-enum]

?   found 1 problems, 0 warnings
?   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint

husky - commit-msg hook exited with code 1 (error)
```
I'd like for the popup to read the actual error: ""input: foo: this will fail, type must be one of [build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test] [type-enum]"".
Instead it shows the first line of output: ""No staged files match any configured task."" which is misleading since that's not the error.

This poster is having the same issue.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29faeab3-4274-44e1-aed8-f04a5905a8f4)
we also tried to add start process of code.exe and killed it so it gets launched at once into the script. but still even after keeping user data files, language package and also start process and kill through script still English language gets displayed.

Summary: On first launch we are getting English language even after keeping all the needed data in user context, but after closing the software and relaunch it manually then only it displays French lang. Not of first launch. Please help us understand if any additional parameters files to be added to make it work on first launch.

147,microsoft/vscode,File Comparison Scrollbar Indicators Render in Wrong Relative Position When Spanning 2 Monitors,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Select and compare 2 files, as normal, by right-clicking on each, in turn, and selecting those appropriate options.
The new comparison tab opens with the visual diff of the 2 files.  Because my primary monitor (1920x1080) isn't wide/large enough to fully see the contents of both files, even with the Explorer pane dismissed, I take VSCode's application window out of 'maximized'/fullscreen mode and then drag the right edge of the application window across into my secondary monitor's (1920x1080) space, until the application window is wide enough to fully see both files.
The scrollbar has what I'll call an overlay to indicate the diffs as red and green in their relative positions in their respective files.   But, when I arrange the application window this way, the red/green diff overlay appears as a floating column in the middle of the right side of the comparison tab.  It's almost as if it's encountered a max-width contraint preventing it from rendering in the correct horizontal position.

- VS Code Version: 1.94.0
- OS Version: macOS Sonoma 14.4

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Listen for `onDidEndTerminalShellExecution` events
2. Run a command that returns some exit code
3. Type the same command and interrupt with ^C (i.e. interrupt without actually running the command)
4. The exit code reported by the `TerminalShellExecution` event for the second execution (expected to be `undefined` since the command didn't actually run) will be the same as the previous command's exit code

For example:
```bash
$ echo test^C
-> exit code undefined
$ echo test
-> exit code 0
$ echo test^C
-> exit code 0
$ echo test^C
-> exit code 0
$ echo not test^C
-> exit code undefined
$ echo test^C
-> exit code undefined
```

Commit: fabdb6a30b49f79a7aba0f2ad9df9b399473380f
Date: 2024-12-19T10:22:47.216Z

Node.js: 20.18.1
V8: 12.8.374.38-electron.0
OS: Darwin arm64 24.2.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Implement configuration change handler for a configuration value that will update a configuration value dynamically (so that when the user has the user settings window open a configuration value will update)
2. Update a configuration value in the user settings UI that will trigger an update to a setting while the user settings window is opened and focused.

Note that the UI will become stale.  If the UI loses focus it will update but it will not update as long as the UI is focused.

155,microsoft/vscode,"Deleting a folder ending in a dot, actually deletes a different folder","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I accidentally created a folder ending with a dot, say `src/app/folder.`, when the directory `src/app/folder` (without a trailing dot) also existed. The folder ending with a dot was an accident, so I tried to delete it. However, when deleting the folder `src/app/folder.` in the GUI, VSCode actually deletes the different folder `src/app/folder`!

While other software (Including Microsoft Windows Explorer) also have trouble deleting folders ending with dots, I think it is good if VSCode also takes this into account.

Despite a folder ending in a dot being a possible illegal path, the fact that these folders can be created and can exist, I think that VSCode should check for these situations to prevent deleting a different folder from the one selected. For me it caused me to lose some uncommitted progress.

In this case, how the folder was created does not matter for the issue VSCode is having, but you can read more about that on [the Issue I created for Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/29275).

I hope this helps!

Please correct me if this is something that's already possible, but I couldn't find any way to do this.

I frequently work in codebases that have multiple remotes, all of which have identical branch names (dev, main, etc.). When I check one of those branches out (say, `origin_a/dev`), my local branch is just named 'dev'. If I try to checkout another branch (say, `origin_b/dev`), the checkout fails because there's already a local branch called 'dev'. I know I can manually rename the existing branch before checking out the second one, but it's a pain to have to remember to do every time. It would be nice to be able to automatically prepend the origin name to the local branch name (with a setting to turn it on/off), or a setting similar to `git.branchPrefix` where you can specify what you'd like to prepend when cloning a branch.","['bug', 'git']",2025-01-06T14:55:08Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/237345,

Spun off from issue #230090 which was closed without investigating / solving the issue. I voiced my frustration that the bug got closed within a week while I was on holiday after I've waited 3 months for an answer. Please don't do the same with this bug.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Launch VS Code with no extension enabled, but hardware acceleration enabled
2. Wait

What happens:

1. RAM usage constantly increases
2. Developer: Process Explorer does not report any usage increase on any of the code main items
3. Eventually the RAM usage caps out, the computer becomes unresponsive, and I have to hard reset it

What I have tried, unsuccessfully:

1. Reinstalled VS Code entirely and re-synced to my Github profile
2. Disabled all extensions
3. Uninstalled all extensions

What I have tried, **successfully**:
1. Disable hardware acceleration in `argv.json` and restart VSCode. Memory leak does not occur.

Memory report from Windows Task Manager as VS Code uses more than 4GB of memory:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/596cba13-d0ed-45ec-976f-2f7267fe3d56)

Memory usage at the same time as the above:

Command line used to launch the software:
`""D:\Users\Mighty\Dropbox\Software\Windows\Tools\VSCode-win32-x64\Code.exe"" `

I noticed page faults are constantly increasing:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ba166dd-d91e-4882-8c58-81a6cf01d377)

I noticed that one of the subprocesses of Code.exe has a constant use of CPU (6.20).
The associated command line is: `""D:\Users\Mighty\Dropbox\Software\Windows\Tools\VSCode-win32-x64\Code.exe"" --type=gpu-process --user-data-dir=""C:\Users\Mighty\AppData\Roaming\Code"" --gpu-preferences=UAAAAAAAAADgAAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgAAEAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAIAAAAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAA --field-trial-handle=1784,i,2806485216046023221,10863828599728893653,262144 --disable-features=CalculateNativeWinOcclusion,PlzDedicatedWorker,SpareRendererForSitePerProcess,WinDelaySpellcheckServiceInit,WinRetrieveSuggestionsOnlyOnDemand --variations-seed-version --mojo-platform-channel-handle=1768 /p`

Below, the stack of the thread that uses that 6.20 CPU amount. Note that I have no idea if it is the thread that is problematic.

164,microsoft/vscode,No hint shown when hovering over type in debugger variables view,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

In #214315, the debugger variables view was changed to show the types of variables. However, if the variable name + type name (with scoped types which might have multiple modules in it, this happens easily; also think of parametrized types) becomes too long for the variables window, of course the value of the variable can no longer be displayed, and the type might also not be display fully.
I would now expect that when I hover over the visible part of the type, I'll get a hint that tells me both the full type as well as the name of the variable. But instead, no hint appears at all, not even for the type itself. I have to resize the variables pane until it is wide enough to show at least the first character of the value, which is both annoying and can sometimes take half to full the screen.
In contrast to this, hovering over the variable name shows the variable name; and hovering over the value (if it is visible) shows the value. I would rather favor an implementation in which the hint shows the value of the full row instead of just the column the mouse is over - who knows, maybe the variable name will also be too long, so that even the type is not shown?

# Terminal Shell Integration Race Condition

## Overview

There is a race condition in VSCode's terminal shell integration where the command finished barrier is released before AsyncIterable consumers receive the sequence data. The sequence of events causing this race is:

1. Process data arrives containing OSC 633 ; D
2. Data is written to xterm.js
3. xterm.js parser immediately processes the sequence
4. Command finished handler is called which releases the barrier
5. Write callback completes and fires onData event
6. AsyncIterable consumers receive the data

The key issue is that steps 3-4 happen before step 5-6. This means:
- The barrier is released in step 4
- But consumers don't receive the data until step 6
- There is no guarantee consumers will see the sequence data before the barrier releases

The ""633;D found"" case explained below (correct behavior) only occurs when the write callback happens to complete before the barrier releases, which is not guaranteed by the current implementation.

### Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?

This is a bug related to an extension API so at least the bug-test plugin below is needed to inspect. **See proof of concept bug test below.**

## Proposed Solution

The race condition can be fixed by delaying the barrier release:
- Wait for write callback completion before releasing the barrier
- Add a promise to track write completion
- Only release after both parse and write are done

This ensures consumers will always see the sequence before the barrier releases, making the behavior deterministic rather than depending on timing.

## Environment

- VS Code Version: Tested on both stable 1.96.2 and insiders 1.97.0
```
Version: 1.97.0-insider
Commit: 89f808979a5151bd91324e65d4f7ab1b62896983
Date: 2024-12-20T05:04:19.167Z
Electron: 32.2.6
ElectronBuildId: 10629634
Chromium: 128.0.6613.186
Node.js: 20.18.1
V8: 12.8.374.38-electron.0
OS: Linux x64 6.6.67
```

- OS Version: Oracle Linux 9
- Extensions: This issue requires an extension to test, as it relates to the terminal shell integration API

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone and run the test extension: https://github.com/KJ7LNW/vsce-test-terminal-integration
2. Load the folder in VSCode and press F5
3. Press ""Run Command"" repeatedly and quickly to watch the counts change
4. Observe the counts - in a correct implementation, only the ""found"" count should increment

## Test Results

Running the test extension shows:
```
OSC ] 633;D
    found:     3     // GOOD: Consumer saw sequence before barrier released (expected behavior)
    not found: 12    // BUG: Barrier released before consumer saw sequence (race condition)
    neither:   1     // Test error or timeout

Example of a ""found"" case (GOOD - expected behavior where consumer sees sequence before barrier, **contains `\x1B]633;D`**):
```
'echo a\r\n' +
'\x1B[?2004l\r\x1B]777;preexec\x1B\\\x1B]633;E;echo a;23d6ea60-059f-428c-9424-a497b533ee7a\x07\x1B]633;C\x07a\r\n' +

```

Example of a ""not found"" case (BUG - race condition where barrier releases too early, **does NOT contain `\x1B]633;D`**):
```
'echo a\r\n' +
'\x1B[?2004l\r\x1B]777;preexec\x1B\\\x1B]633;E;echo a;8680055d-1545-4c64-859d-3c4ff3a0c412\x07\x1B]633;C\x07a\r\n'
```

## Expected Behavior

The barrier should only be released after AsyncIterable consumers have received and processed the command finished sequence. The ""found"" count should increment consistently, indicating consumers reliably see the sequence before the barrier releases. The ""not found"" count should always be zero in a correct implementation.

## Actual Behavior

The barrier is frequently released before consumers receive the sequence data:
- Only 20% of runs (3/15) had the correct behavior (found case)
- 80% of runs (12/15) exhibited the race condition (not found case)
- The high rate of ""not found"" cases demonstrates this is a real race condition affecting most command executions

## Technical Details

The race condition can also be verified by:
1. Adding logging to the write callback in TerminalInstance._writeProcessData
2. Adding logging to the command finished handler in ShellIntegrationAddon
3. Observing that the command finished handler logs appear before write callback logs

This confirms the sequence is parsed and handled before the write completes and reaches consumers.

## Alternative Solutions

Event Ordering:
- Modify xterm.js to guarantee write callback executes before parser
- Would require changes to xterm.js event handling architecture
- Most invasive but provides strongest guarantees

However, the delay barrier release approach is simpler and more robust, especially given the empirical evidence showing the high frequency of the race condition in practice.

167,microsoft/vscode,Problem with anchor $ in the search-replace menu on a corner case,"Hi,

Sorry in advance it's a corner case but I ran into this problem when I wanted to make a ""trim"" of all my files in my working directory.

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes

- VS Code Version: 1.96.2 (fabdb6a30b49f79a7aba0f2ad9df9b399473380f, x64)
- OS Version: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

## Steps to Reproduce
 
In my `/tmp/test/` directory, I have this:

```sh
$ cd /tmp/test/

$ ls -la
total 52
drwxrwxr-x  2 flaf flaf  4096 Jan  3 03:09 ./
drwxrwxrwt 18 root root 40960 Jan  3 03:11 ../
-rw-rw-r--  1 flaf flaf     4 Jan  3 03:13 f

# f is a file which contains the characters 1, a, a, a and that's all. No \n character at the end of file.
$ echo -n 1aaa > f

$ od -c f
0000000   1   a   a   a
0000004

# Just in case.
$ sha1sum f
a2cf0d12061ff31135c431770b3c78b73a1586f6  f
```

### 1. The normal case (to me)

I open the file `f` like this:

```sh
$ code --disable-extensions f
```
Then I make this search/replace:
* pattern: `$(?!\n)` with regex enabled. <= to me it's the anchor ""end of file"".
* replace all by `REPLACE\n`.
* I save and quit vscode.

Here is the result:

```sh
$ cat f
1aaaREPLACE

$ od -c f
0000000   1   a   a   a   R   E   P   L   A   C   E  \n
0000014

$ sha1sum f
e519a419f0563b6206c7cfb923a48a3b339857f6  f
```

To me it's OK. `REPLACE\n` has been added at the end of the file `f`.

### 2. Now, the strange case (to me)

First I rewrite the file `f` to its initial state:

```sh
$ echo -n 1aaa > f

$ od -c f
0000000   1   a   a   a
0000004

$ sha1sum f
a2cf0d12061ff31135c431770b3c78b73a1586f6  f
```
Then I do exactly the same process, except I launch vscode like this:

```sh
# The argument is ""."" (not f), ie my working directory /tmp/test/ which just contains f.
$ code --disable-extensions .
```

Then I make exactly the same search/replace:

* pattern: `$(?!\n)` with regex enabled. <= to me it's the anchor ""end of file"".
* replace all by `REPLACE\n`.
* I save and quit vscode.

And here is the result:

```sh
$ cat f
REPLACE
aaa

$ od -c f
0000000   R   E   P   L   A   C   E  \n   a   a   a  \n
0000014

$ sha1sum f
a6a80a922d25d514684489409a3269ca62becaf4  f
```

Voilà. Hope it's clear. I admit that the bug (if it is) isn't huge, but it's strange. :)","['bug', 'search']",2025-01-03T02:51:51Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/237203,Logical Bug

169,microsoft/vscode,Git - Saving/closing COMMIT_EDITMSG during a git commit randomly does not complete the commit,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

This is a random issue. I have not found a sequence that specificly makes this fail.

This issue is that when I use the editor's COMMIT_EDITMSG file to write my commit message, (click Commit button with and empty Message input) the message saves, but the commit does not complete.

The commit messages are usually somewhat extensive (several paragraphs). I review diffs of the files I'm committing as I write the commit message so  I am in and out of focus on the file. But it has also happend when I simply paste a commit message in and immediately close the file.

I have tried several versions of closing out of the file to submit the commit:
- Save then close the file (I don't remember if I get a prompt in this case)
- Close (cmd-W or click the close button) the file and click the save button in the prompt
- Close (cmd-W or click the close button) the file and click enter to select the default (save) button in the prompt.

All three of these have successfully submitted the commit, and failed to do so. The edited content appears to save into `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`.

I have checked the git output and don't see any consistent error messages. There are lines that seem to be associated with commiting when the commit works, and they are simply missing when it doesn't. The only thing close to an error is when the commit works there are two similar warnings:

There is no upstream remote for this project. I have tried to clip out what seems to be the significant section of the logs for brevity, but have saved the all of the log if you need it.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Activate any color theme with sidebars that use a different color scheme than the main editor window.
2. Open Copilot Edits.

Items in the sidebar may be invisible or difficult to see depending on the source elements use color. In this example, the main editor uses a light background with dark text, while the sidebars use a dark background with light text. The Copilot Edits file list uses the background of the main editor and the text color of the sidebars, causing its text to have almost no contrast against its background.

I suggest that sidebar widgets should select colors from a single source section that would use paired background/foreground. I.e., all from the editor settings, all from sidebar settings, etc.","['bug', 'cross-file-editing']",2024-12-27T19:31:10Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/237014,UI/UX Bug

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->

The `http.proxy` setting can only be configured in user settings. I’m wondering if it’s possible to set it in workspace settings instead.

When using a dev container, the `http.proxy` setting is passed to the container. However, the container cannot use the proxy on the local machine unless additional configuration is done. 

If `http.proxy` could be configured directly in `.vscode/settings.json` or `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, it would make things much easier for users. Currently, we have to either modify the user settings each time or set up a more complex container network configuration.

This has already been requested in #128981 but was chalked up to git's limitations despite git clearly being able to detect the file changes and, as a result, reconcile the file history (i.e. Timeview) even after a rename.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Rename or move a file with `git mv` without modifying any file contents.
1. Commit
1. Click on any commit in the Timeview

Expected behavior:

No change to timeview or individual commit contents.

Actual behavior:

The timeline and commit names are shown, but the contents are empty:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f26f494-1882-4c16-9568-13bfc253e907)

Edit: to be clear, renames can be both detected and dealt with using the following commands:

- List all the renames in the repo:
```git
> git log --summary --diff-filter=dam # all the renames in the repo
...
rename OldFileName1.ps1 => NewFileName1.ps1 (97%)
rename OldFileName2.ps1 => NewFileName2.ps1 (100%)
...
```
- List all the renames for a particular file:
```
> git log --summary --diff-filter=dam --follow -- .\NewFileName1.ps1 # for a particular file
...
rename OldFileName1.ps1 => NewFileName1.ps1 (97%)
...
```
- Show file contents for a particular file before a rename:
```
git show 42fcd1b:OldFileName1.ps1
```
... where `42fcd1b` is the commit hash.

There are probably other, possibly better, ways, but this is the most straightforward way I've found and been using.

181,microsoft/vscode,"Snippet variables $LINE_COMMENT, $BLOCK_COMMENT_START, and $BLOCK_COMMENT_END not working in new C# file","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I created a new workspace with a new dotnet console application.
In the .vscode folder, I created the following snippets.code-snippets file.  For brevity, I've removed the comments.
```
{
   ""copyright"": {
      ""scope"": ""csharp"",
      ""prefix"": ""cr"",
      ""isFileTemplate"": true,
      ""description"": ""description"",
      ""body"": [
         ""$BLOCK_COMMENT_START Block Comment"",
         ""$BLOCK_COMMENT_END"",
         ""$LINE_COMMENT copyright $CURRENT_YEAR fizzbin"",
         ""$LINE_COMMENT A second line""
      ]
   }
}

```

When I create a new file via Command + N, click ""fill with template"", and select my above template, I get the following file:

> Block Comment
> 
>  copyright 2024 fizzbin
>  A second line
> 
Note that these are not comments.  They should be comments.

If I goto Extensions in the sidebar, and disable all extensions, the above still happens.  Note that I also tried this on a Linux system (Debian Bookworm, Arm64, same VSCode version), with the same results.

<img width=""756"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76dffda1-6f51-4b8f-9e4f-17d485d58ea4"" />
On the left is the window that i'm working on the local repo, On the right is the window that I ssh-ed to the location on my server. You can see on the right side it is not showing the same commit activities as on the left. 
I tried to look at git output. They are totally the same and no error messages. 

This is never a problem when I am working on a local repository. Which is why I think this might be a bug. 

I can still sync from the cloud properly. When I do so, the Source Control Graph will also update at the same time properly.

183,microsoft/vscode,copilot-debug terminal integration breaks python venv activation,"- Copilot Chat Extension Version: 0.23.2
- VS Code Version: 1.96.2
- OS Version: Windows 11
- Logs:

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Start with a clean VSCode profile
2. Install the [python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
3. Create a virtual environment and set it as the python interpreter
4. Open a new terminal and run `(get-command python).Source` (or equivalent for your shell): it should point to the python interpreter from the virtual environment, because the Python extension activates the environment for you and prepends it to `env:PATH`
5. Now, install Copilot Chat and restart VSCode
6. Open a new terminal and re-run `(get-command python).Source`: this time, it should point to the global python interpreter.

The issue seems to be that both Python extension and Copilot Chat seem to be trying to modify the PATH at the same time, probably overriding each others changes (even if in my case, Copilot Chat seems to always override Python).

Even worse, Copilot Chat seems to completely ignore the `""github.copilot.chat.copilotDebugCommand.enabled"": false` setting, with the extension *still* trying to add features to the terminal.

184,microsoft/vscode,Document how to use VS Code Tunnels reliably for more than 2 or 3 days without disconnection,"Many vscode users have reported that it's difficult or impossible to keep vscode tunnels running for multiple days. 

This an ongoing problem with no clear solution.

Maybe what is needed is a suggestion for some kind of hack that will send a ping or data every few minutes, to keep the connection alive?

Various issues about this have been created and then closed by the vscode developers, most recently here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230058#issuecomment-2393103391

Before this issue was closed @connor4312 suggested that logging in with a Microsoft account might make VS code tunnels more reliable.

We've done extensive testing of this over the last week, using Microsoft accounts instead of Github and found that we have not fixed the problem this way.

Typically a vs code tunnel will stay online for roughly 2 to 5 days, and then will fail.

Now that we've switch to MS account, we reliably get a failure message like this when the tunnel disconnects:


```
Dec 20 08:55:08 code-tunnel[3683048]: [2024-12-20 08:55:08] warn Error refreshing access token, will retry: failed to lookup tunnel for host token: response error: HTTP status 401 Unauthorized from https://usw3.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/tunnels/REDACTED-94lzwh5?tokenScopes=host&api-version=2023-09-27-preview (request ID fb9d5243-5aa8-48fd-aace-71f027a4fee8):
```

To fix this, we have found we need to follow these steps on Linux.... it seems to require opening the Vs code GUI application, there is no reliable way we have found to do this on the CLI.

1. Close vscode if it is running,
2. Re-open vscode
3. Stop tunnel if it is running.
4. Start tunnel
5. Login with microsoft

185,microsoft/vscode,"""command"" content interpretation broken in tasks.json, possible arg tokenization problem?","After latest update to VSCode Insiders, interpretation of `tasks.json` appears to have changed in a way that breaks how I'm currently using it.

A task containing a command of the form:

```      
""env"": {
  ""PYTHON"": ""tools/vscode/scripts/python.sh"",
},
...
""command"": ""$PYTHON -m tools.vscode.scripts.compdb_service""
```

Results in terminal output of:

```
/bin/bash: $PYTHON -m tools.vscode.scripts.compdb_service: No such file or directory
```

After a bunch of testing, it appears that VSCode changed how ""command"" is interpreted. Previously it seemed like it was treated like `bash -c ""$COMMAND""` to now being executed as `bash ""$COMMAND""`.


However attempts to pass args separately via:
```
""args"": [""-m"", ""tools.vscode.scripts.compdb_service""]
```

...resulted in the same failure indicating a deeper problem. It seems to imply it's executing something like `bash ""$COMMAND $ARGS""` 

Attempts to manually expand env var PYTHON also resulted in same failure.

The exact same `tasks.json` works just fine on the latest normal VSCode.

186,microsoft/vscode,theme-color is not updated when the PWA is inactive.,"- VS Code Version: 1.97.0-insider
- OS Version: PWA (Mac OS, but should apply to all)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set the colour `titleBar.inactiveBackground` to something significantly different to the `activeBackground` to easily distinguish the focused app.
2. Focus on any other app.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77590a3f-b277-4fc2-bfe4-13d7258e58a8)

Notice that even when the PWA is inactive, it still takes the theme-color from the active titlebar background.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/workbench/browser/style.ts#L27-L41

I think that ideally the theme-color would match the titlebar colour, regardless of whether the app is active or not.

I have a 27"" 4K monitor as my main display and a 24"" 1080p monitor as a secondary display. To make everything have consistent sizes between the two displays, I have set my main display to 175% scale. The majority of VS Code scales accordingly, but the minimap does not, which results in it being very small and difficult to use. I can change `editor.minimap.scale` to 2 to account for this on my main display, but then if I move a window over to my secondary display, the minimap is far too large.

I would like the minimap to automatically account for display scaling (or have a way to set a different scale per display) such that it is a consistent size on my two displays. This may require supporting non-integer scales (#84168), or it could round to the nearest integer (which may not be ideal for 150% scale).","['bug', 'editor-minimap', 'under-discussion']",2024-12-19T16:36:21Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/236606,UI/UX Bug

Currently, updating Visual Studio code involves the following steps:
1. Click the cog.
2. Click the ""Install Update"" button.
3. Enter admin credentials.
4. **Wait a few seconds.**
5. **Click the cog.**
6. **Click the ""Update Now"" button.**
7. Wait for the update to install.

I would like this to be simplified to the following steps:
1. Click the cog.
2. Click the ""Install Update"" button.
3. Enter admin credentials.
4. Wait for update to install.

The extra couple of clicks are a minor annoyance that adds to all the other minor annoyances throughout the day, which lead to eventual subsurface rage that has no time or space to dissipate over the short weekends, surrounded by screaming kids, before returning to the fray again on Monday.","['bug', 'install-update']",2024-12-19T10:49:04Z,4,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/236569,

```

My extension's Language Server provides snippets to complete function documentation as part of its `textDocument/completion` handler. Here is an example snippet it provides:

```
;---------
; SCOPE:        ${1|PRIVATE,INTERNAL,PUBLIC|}
; DESCRIPTION:  ${2}
; PARAMETERS:
;   subject (${3|I,O,IO|},${4|REQ,OPT|}${5}) - ${6}
;   body (${7|I,O,IO|},${8|REQ,OPT|}${9}) - ${10}
;   inst (${11|I,O,IO|},${12|REQ,OPT|}${13}) - ${14}
;   interval (${15|I,O,IO|},${16|REQ,OPT|}${17}) - ${18}
;${0}
;---------
```

When the user offers the snippet, the content is inserted correctly. However, when they tab to one of the lines below `PARAMETERS:` and stop on any of the `${X|I,O,IO|}` and `${X|REQ,OPT|}` tab choices, they can no longer Shift+Tab to a tab stop before the choice. Interestingly, if the user has reached the `${2}` tab stop, they can tab back to the `$1` choice.  

In order to verify this was not an issue with the extension itself, I copied this snippet to be a user-configured global snippet per [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets).

```json
{
	""Function Header"": {
		""scope"": """",
		""prefix"": "";"",
		""body"": [
			"";---------"",
			""; SCOPE:        ${1|PRIVATE,INTERNAL,PUBLIC|}"",
			""; DESCRIPTION:  ${2}"",
			""; PARAMETERS:"",
			"";   subject (${3|I,O,IO|},${4|REQ,OPT|}${5}) - ${6}"",
			"";   body (${7|I,O,IO|},${8|REQ,OPT|}${9}) - ${10}"",
			"";   inst (${11|I,O,IO|},${12|REQ,OPT|}${13}) - ${14}"",
			"";   interval (${15|I,O,IO|},${16|REQ,OPT|}${17}) - ${18}"",
			"";${0}"",
			"";---------""
		]
	}
}
```

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create this snippet in your global snippet configuration
2. In a new document, accept the snippet
3. Tab to the `I/O/IO` tab choice on the line `subject` parameter.
4. You can no longer shift tab back to `${2}`

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Hello,

I have a similar issue like #113702, but on a ubuntu distribution and I cant get it to fix. 

# Problem:
Vscode is always reverting its version back to 1.90.2. When I do the update, I can open a vscode window or two in the right version, but after 10minutes or so, its back to version 1.90.2

# What I tried:
 - updating to different versions (1.94, 1.95,1.96)
- complete reinstall of vscode (I couldnt find it on the machine afterwards)

I did:
```
sudo apt-get purge code
rm -r $Home/.config/Code 
rm -r $Home/.vscode

```
The issue still persists. I dont know where else vscode files could be or what the issue would be releated to.

I opened a 180MB csv file intending to cut it down to a few lines to produce a smaller sample from it. Then instead of ""save as"" i pressed ctrl+s by habit and overwrote the full file. But that shouldn't have been fatal - undo should have been available to return the editing buffer to before cutting out the extra lines. Unfortunately, it wasn't - undo/redo just switched between an entirely blank file (even tho the file never was blank) and the end state after several edits, no in-between state.

In Terminal view,the 'Next/Previous Match' search function conflicts with the redirection triggered by Ctrl+Left Click. When Ctrl+Click is used during a search, clicking 'Next Match' immediately jumps to the first match instead of proceeding as expected.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter multiple characters in the Terminal.
2. Press Ctrl+F to search for the characters. 
3. Use 'Next Match' to move the search position to the middle. 
4. Press Ctrl+Click on any word. 
5. Click 'Next Match' again.

Expected:
Next Match Goes to the next position to the middle.
Actual:
Next Match: Go to the first one.

198,microsoft/vscode,"Title bar too big in some screens, does not scale with zoom","In Ubuntu 24.04 under Wayland, in my main hidpi monitor, the title bar size is correct. When I connect a second (bigger) monitor, and other applications are moved over to the second screen, they are correctly automatically resized down (their size in pixel decreased, so their physical size stays more or less constant). VSCode is not resized, and therefore appears too big. I can zoom out inside VSCode so the size is corrected, but this does not affect the title bar, which, as can be seen in the image, stays way too big compared to other windows (next to a terminal in the example).

There could be two ways of fixing this behavior: allow zooming out the title bar, and/or make vscode correctly resize when moving to a monitor of different size. Ideally both.

Changing the `padding` to `2px` just for the part titles, makes the actions be misaligned with other toolbars, such as the custom title. In this case notice how a secondary sidebar below the custom title aligns the actions differently:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eab8e8ad-584b-43ca-aa8f-57cd1b88d633)

I think we need to be careful of spreading `margin` or `padding` changes into views only so that we can ensure other locations still look the same.

Why not have the `2px` change on the toolbar itself?","['bug', 'under-discussion', 'layout', 'papercut :drop_of_blood:']",2024-12-16T12:58:57Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/236223,UI/UX Bug

When dealing with webviews using the standalone version of Monaco Editor, we'd like to align our environment with the current VS Code state. That means if the user is currently using `overtype` mode, that should be activated by default in our webviews.

We'd like to have access to:

- `inputMode: 'insert' | 'overtype'`
- `onDidChangeInputMode(...)`

- VS Code Version: 1.96.0 and 1.97-0-insider
- OS Version: Windows 11 Pro 24H2 26100.2605

Steps to Reproduce:

In a TypeScript file, put your cursor immediately before an opening (left) curly brace and press Enter.  The curly brace will be indented, which is incorrect behavior.

- VS Code Version: 1.96.0 (RPM from the Microsoft repo)
- OS Version: Fedora 41

The `%post` scriptlet in the RPM spec file deletes `/usr/local/bin/code` even if it doesn't belong to a previous vscode installation. This is very irritating because it's the easiest way to append arbitrary command line arguments such as `--ozone-platform=wayland` **system-wide**. Please either add some validation before deleting it, or just stop deleting it altogether.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1.96.0/resources/linux/rpm/code.spec.template#L48-L51

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install a script at `/usr/local/bin/code` which launches `/usr/bin/code` with extra arguments
2. Reinstall the RPM file provided by Microsoft
3. `/usr/local/bin/code` is now deleted

- VS Code Version: 1.96.0
- OS Version: macOS 14.7.1
- Github Codespaces extension version: 1.17.3

1. Open a Github Codespace using the Codespaces extension
2. Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in the codespace

Then this window pops up:

<img width=""497"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b357253-d347-4d2e-9b8b-fdd90c90cc8e"" />

It seems that opening a `devcontainer.json` file causes VS Code or the Codespaces extension to try to invoke `git` locally, which opens a window if the ""command line tools"" package from Apple isn't installed.

In my opinion, VS Code shouldn't be trying to invoke git locally if I am only using it to access a codespace. But if it is necessary, perhaps VS Code should first check if git is available.","['bug', 'git']",2024-12-14T02:58:34Z,4,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/236120,Logical Bug

I am using Fira Code for both the terminal and the editor, which supports ""infinite ligatures"", one of which is joining multiple #####################'s into one continuous mark by connecting the horizontal strokes.

This works perfectly fine in the editor windows. However when I turn on the ligatures in the terminal, it only works for about ~32 characters before the ligaturized characters vanish.

this is probably a problem with xterm.js but on the chance that it's with vs code's implementation of ligatures I figured I'd report it here first and let the vs code maintainers decide whether it needs to be reported upstream.

- VS Code Version: 1.96?
- OS Version: Windows 11

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Ensure there are no VS Code running
2. Try to open VS Code ""indirectly"", e.g. via GitHub Desktop ""Open in Visual Studio Code"" or via command line `code`
3. Immediately see error; this error holds for a short while, and then the entire window disappears

Directly opening VS Code from e.g. the start menu works, but that defeats the entire purpose of being able to start VS Code from other places. If somehow there is already a VS Code window running, then the above error doesn't occur.

Example error window:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8f0376e-b246-419b-8992-7b6b8c43d334)

Normally, even `code --crash-reporter-directory` as mentioned in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Native-Crash-Issues#creating-a-crash-report can result in the same error, and this will NOT result in crash dumps (???), but I am lucky enough that it sometimes passes through, and now I have a crash dump for this error.

**Crash dump**:
[20241212_vscode_dump.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18114765/20241212_vscode_dump.zip)

For further context, my Windows 11 has OneDrive cloud backup enabled. I notice this cloud backup may somehow hold file locks that it should not (especially when it has completed the backup), which can sometimes block other apps eg Office Word from saving the Word file because the file is ""in use"" by OneDrive. Not sure if this is relevant in this problem.","['bug', 'freeze-slow-crash-leak', 'windows', 'sandbox', 'mitigated']",2024-12-12T16:45:38Z,7,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/235973,Logical Bug
214,microsoft/vscode,Jupyter Notebook Extention Terminated Unexpectedly,"Steps to Reproduce
Install the Jupyter and Python extensions in Visual Studio Code.
Open a Python file or a Jupyter notebook.
Set the Python interpreter to Python 3.9.19 from the Anaconda distribution (~\Anaconda3\python.exe).
Attempt to run Python scripts or interact with the notebook environment.
Expected Behavior
The extensions should activate successfully, and the Python/Jupyter environment should work without errors.
**Actual Behavior**
The extension host terminates unexpectedly three times within five minutes, disrupting the workflow.
The issue persists after:
Clearing workspace storage.
Reinstalling the Jupyter and Python extensions.
Reinstalling Visual Studio Code with default settings.
Verifying the environment variables and paths are properly set to Anaconda Python.

### Summary of Tests and Findings

#### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Verified microphone functionality:
   - Microphone works as expected in other applications.
   - Tested using `pactl` and `parecord` to confirm audio input is functioning properly.
2. Reinstalled **VS Code** and **VS Code Insiders** from scratch.
3. Installed the required VS Code extension for speech-to-text functionality.
4. When pressing **Alt+Ctrl+V**, the microphone icon appears, indicating that the session starts successfully. However, speech is not transcribed to text.
5. Examined the speech log:
   ```
   2024-12-12 11:37:33.892 [trace] [vscode-speech-0] starting speech-to-text session 
   (language: en-US, model: Microsoft Speech Recognizer en-US FP Model V9, 
   path: /home/d/.vscode-insiders/extensions/ms-vscode.vscode-speech-0.12.1-linux-x64/assets/stt)
   ```
6. Examined  renedring.log after starting vscode speech by pressing ctrl+alt+v 

```
[error] Extension host (LocalProcess pid: 32490) terminated unexpectedly. The following extensions were running: vscode.github-authentication, vscode.emmet, vscode.git-base, vscode.git, vscode.github, vscode.debug-auto-launch, vscode.merge-conflict, ms-vscode.vscode-speech
[info] Automatically restarting the extension host.

```
### Related Issue

The issue appears to align with a previously **Closed** GitHub issue #207290  where users reported similar behavior:  
- The speech-to-text extension starts but does not transcribe audio input despite showing no visible errors or crashes.

Steps to Reproduce:

I updated vscode to 1.96 after being prompted in app.

After update, which seemed to go smoothly, I was unable to start vscode, and I was told 'executable missing'. After searching for the executable, I found it in `C:\Users\caj\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\_` (note weird file underscore). The main ""Microsoft VS Code"" directory just contains 3 files,  `unins000.dat`, `exe` and `msg`, and some directories.

`winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode` tells me it can't reinstall vscode, as it's already installed.

If I run `code.exe` from inside the `_` directory, things seem to work fine.

I plan on blasting the whole thing away, and reinstalling from scratch, but I'll wait a day before doing that, just in case there is a log file anyone wants me to grab, in case they want to figure out how I ended up in this situation.","['bug', 'install-update']",2024-12-12T07:38:09Z,1,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/235896,Dependency Issue

OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.22631
```

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a vscode workspace with many tests (in my case ~150,000)
2. Wait for the language extension to discover all the tests in the project. In my case this is done by C# Dev Kit, though I doubt this matters.
3. switching between code editor tabs takes a full second for vscode to become responsive again.

I profiled the extension host while it was hanging, which show practically 0% CPU usage.

Next, I profiled the main window. See [Trace-20241211T121347.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18094526/Trace-20241211T121347.json)

The bulk of time is spent in `encodeURIComponentFast` which is triggered by [`testingDecorations.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4fb4fc90310a408a4f5c6216372e634634ae8ea0/src/vs/workbench/contrib/testing/browser/testingDecorations.ts#L517-L526):

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f507c009-c307-41c0-98e3-5aec34ba6421)


Notes:
- This happens on all editors in the window, even on file types not associated with the tests. E.g. switching between Markdown files is slow too. Though, switching to e.g. the ""Settings"" tabs doesn't have this problem, presumably because it isn't a code editor.
- The delay is the same regardless of whether the open file contains any tests or not.
- I have the Test Gutter disabled, so AFAIK, there no need to be computing this information in the first place.
- Observation as someone not familiar with this codebase all: I notice the [code in question](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4fb4fc90310a408a4f5c6216372e634634ae8ea0/src/vs/workbench/contrib/testing/browser/testingDecorations.ts#L517-L526) already ""spawns"" an `async` function to prevent blocking. Though, looking at the profile, all `await` points end up being scheduled on the microtask queue of the original `mousedown` event handler, so the UI rendering is blocked anyway.","['bug', 'author-verification-requested', 'testing']",2024-12-11T11:50:13Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/235819,Performance Issue

1. Change TitleBar style to `native`;
2. Start VS Code with command `code --ozone-platform=wayland`. With or without options `--ozone-platform-hint` and `--enable-features` it does not matter;
3. Try to resize window with mouse;

- VS Code Version: 1.95.3 (Universal)
- OS Version: macOS 15.1.1 (24B91)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the Copilot Chat side panel.
2. Change VSCode language via `Configure Display Language` command. Confirm `Restart` button.
3. VScode restarts and successfully switches to new language. Copilot Chat still displaying with old language.
4. Reload VSCode via `Developer: Reload Window` command. (This step must be performed after Copilot Chat has finished initializing.)
5. Copilot Chat switches to new language successfully.

P.S. `renderWelcomeViewContentIfNeeded` cache is likely the culprit. It is called before `viewModel` exists.

- VS Code Version: Web
- OS Version: iPadOS 18.1 (Safari)

VSCode Web on iPadOS/Safari appears to be erroneously encoding certain copied text as a URL.

So copying this string of text from a VSCode Web file:
`foo: bar`

And pasting it into another VSCode web file will result in:
`foo:%20bar`

This is only the case if there isn’t a space before the colon anywhere on the line. So,
` foo: bar` and `foo bar: baz` both copy and paste normally.

This also only happens within VSCode web. So, copying `foo: bar` from an external app and pasting it into VSCode Web or copying `foo: bar` from VSCode web into another app both work fine.

I have not been able to reproduce this on VSCode Web on Mac or Windows. 


Steps to Reproduce:

1. On iPadOS on Safari, open a new file on VSCode Web (or Github Codespaces)
2. Write text `foo: bar`
3. Copy to clipboard, where the first character of selection is NOT whitespace
4. Paste into same file.

2. Search for a file (with `CTRL`+`P`) under the `code` directory using its full path (such as `code/main.py`)

Expected outcome:
The search menu shows the requested file

Actual outcome:
The search menu does not list the file

- VS Code Version:  1.95.3-1731513102
- OS Version:  Pop OS (based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) with the new COSMIC desktop

Steps to Reproduce:

I just installed VS Code using official instructions for Ubuntu, since Pop OS is a derivative of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

I was able to run it once, and tried to select the light theme from the popup down left. That did not bring up the expected popup menu.

I then quit VS Code and now I'm unable to run it again, the window shows up and immediately disappears.

1. Run VS Code from command line or launcher icon
2. Watch its window come up and then immediately shut down

I do understand that COSMIC is a brand new desktop environment and it may contain bugs, but all my other applications seem to be working normally (Sublime Text and Merge, Android Studio, JetBrains GoLand).

I'm going to attach the output of ""code --verbose"" here.

### What happened?

when the javascript output has a </script> closing tag, it appears to be able to close the script element which is used for running the javascript, so the remainder of the javascript and some of the internal code used to run/render the javascript output end up outside the script as just html

this happens both when running it the first time and also when viewing a notebook/cell which has already been run

also running multiple times will cause it to output multiple times

243,microsoft/vscode,Brackets Snippet deleting chars,"Brackets Snippet in replace mode deletes char when prefix already exists
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70acd3cb-be83-486f-a9bd-9acd809b45c4)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set `editor.suggest.insertMode` to `replace`
1. Create new global snippet `workbench.action.openSnippets`
```jsonc
{
	""Brackets"": {
		""scope"": ""plaintext"",
		""prefix"": ""()"",
		""body"": ""()"",
		""description"": ""Set `editor.suggest.insertMode` to `replace`\nWhen `()` already exists, the snippet deletes the next following char\n ""
	}
}
```
2. Create new `plaintext` file with example text
```
()!!
()  
()aa
```
3. Place cursor in-between brackets
4. Press ctrl+space and select `Brackets` Snippet

Expected:
nothing
(Cursor moves 1 to the right)
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b1c21c8-0ecc-4593-9c10-505f995e9880)

Actual:
1 character is deleted after the `()` ??
doesn't matter if the char is a `wordPattern` or `wordSeparator` or `whitespace`
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26548e46-133c-4f66-94df-4d06c23c6579)



Notice that using other characters other than brackets `()` does **not** result in chars being deleted

247,microsoft/vscode,"On MacOs with Voiceover, one can't know the cell number in the notebook view","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

	1.	Launch VS Code, open a Jupyter notebook, enable VoiceOver, and focus on the cells view (focused by default).
	2.	Navigate between cells using the up and down arrow keys.
	3.	Observe how VoiceOver announces the cells.

Expected Behavior:
In addition to the existing announcement, VoiceOver should report the cell’s positional information, e.g., “Cell 3 of 20.”

Actual Behavior:
No such announcement is made.

Note:
This appears to be a regression, possibly introduced in VS Code 195 or a similar version. While the removal of the aforementioned announcement is a welcome change on Windows—where screen readers like NVDA automatically provide such information—it creates an issue on macOS, as VoiceOver fails to replicate this behavior.

As a result, users cannot easily determine their position within the notebook, leading to a more confusing experience.

This is completely bonkers! Not only is this **not sensible indentation**, but crucially, the pasted code **alters the contents of the string**!!!!!!

Sometimes, when pasting a multi-line string into a region of code with different indentation than the one the original string was copied from, one doesn't get the desired indentation and that's expected because the contents of the string are sacred. The IDE doesn't know whether the whitespaces inside the string matter, so, at least by default, it preserves the contents of the string at the expense of indentation. And that's expected.

But here, the resulting indentation makes no sense AND the contents of the pasted string are altered with  respect to the copied one!! This makes no sense whatsoever! The indentation of the code where the new code is pasted is the same as where the code is copied from, so there's no need to alter the indentation in the first place, but the IDE is removing spaces for no reason whatsoever AND it's changing the contents of  a pasted string, even unnecessarily.

OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.22631
- OS Version: 

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install VS Code
2. Enable syncing of profiles
3. Try to uninstall an extension you have installed in your profile

Expected:
The extension to remain uninstalled

Actual:
The extension is re-installed within seconds of having uninstalled it.  I tried to upload a video to show the issue but it keeps failing.  

### Workaround
Thankfully I have the old computer still handy that originated the sync data.  If I uninstall the extension from the original computer, ~~the change is then propogated to my new computer~~ (edited because my observation was wrong) I can then uninstall the extension on the other computer and it remains uninstalled.

259,microsoft/vscode,`shellIntegration.ps1` adds additional errors to `$Error` variable when errors occur,"## Env info

- VS Code Version: 1.95.3
- OS Version:  Windows 11 24H2 x64
- PowerShell version: v7.4.6 x64
- Extension: PowerShell v2024.0

## Reproduce

In a PowerShell Extension terminal, do:

```pwsh
# Clear error
$Error.Clear()

# Invoke request known to fail
$null = Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri 'https://graph.microsoft.com' -Body @{'test' = [string]'test'} 

# Count errors, should be 1 but is 3
$Error.Count
```

I then found out by looking at `$Error[0]` that one of the errors were added by VSCode `shellIntegration.ps1`.

```pwsh
PS > $Error[0].InvocationInfo

Could find `shellIntegration.ps1`, but I can't find that invocation line in it.

Doing the same in ""vanilla"" `pwsh -NoProfile` only adds one error to the `$Error` variable:

260,microsoft/vscode,`terminal.shellIntegration.executeCommand` doesn't execute the command in new shells in Powershell 7 on macOS,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

### Steps to reproduce

1. Set PowerShell 7 as default shell in VS Code for Mac. In my case I installed Powershell 7 with Homebrew
```jsonc
// settings.json
{
    ""terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx"": ""pwsh"",
}
```
2. Create a simple project to launch it, like a node project:
```javascript
// index.js
import http from 'http';

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```
3. Add a launch.json to start the program:
```jsonc
// .vscode/launch.json
{
    ""version"": ""0.2.0"",
    ""configurations"": [
        {
            ""name"": ""Launch Program"",
            ""command"": ""node ./index.js"",
            ""request"": ""launch"",
            ""type"": ""node-terminal""
        },
    ]
}
```

4. Launch the program (F5) and see.

### Result

It doesn't start unless you click Enter in the terminal

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e292490c-684d-43c6-a014-f23ffcdb1f51

### Extra info

If you change the default terminal to bash or other shell, it works fine and starts immediately.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b20f6d13-7281-44ff-b864-7f59bbd0b50b

It works fine in Windows

This issue is very similar to this one: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116213

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a PR on GitHub.
2. Go to Files changed, press '.' on keyboard.
3. VSCode for GitHub is launched, open a changed file in this PR.
4. Open a changed file, select some entity that does appear in other files (function name, class, etc)
5. Press Ctrl-Shift-F, and search for said entity.
6. Only occurrences in the currently opened file are displayed.
7. Open some other file that mentions that entity.
8. Search again.
9. Now Search results show occurrences in two files, but not other ones, which do mention this entity.
10. Close one of the files, search again.
11. Now Search results show occurrences only in one file.

Expected Behavior: The search returns results for all instances of the string, regardless if the file is open or not.

263,microsoft/vscode,`vscode://vscode-remote/wsl+<distro>/path/to/file` des not use already open window ,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Try opening a file on the WSL filesystem, let's say /home/USERNAME/.profile, using this URI: `vscode://file/home/USERNAME/.profile`. Instead of opening the intended file, I get an error dialog complaining that `\home\USERNAME\.profile` (with backslashes!) does not exist.

This is rather unfortunate. I asked ChatGPT for a workaround but its recommended solution (use `vscode://vscode-remote/wsl+<distro>/path/to/file`) does not work correctly: it closes the WSL instance of VS Code, creating a brand new instance with *just* the designated file, and also doesn't solve the problem of links generated by tools assuming a local VS code instance.

Does not repro with acceleration disabled. When collapsing a section in the editor, the three dots appear and the end of the line allowing the user to click and expand the section. 

After clicking the symbol, rather than disappearing, it remains present and interactable. However, clicking is just a noop.

Also note what looks to maybe be a double rendered line, the text all grew bolder and appeared almost fuzzy

Here are two examples in python and in typescript for the same problem. If a variable has parentheses around it, the debug hover for getters doesn't work.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Python code:

```py
a = ''
a.isupper()
(a).isupper()
print(a)  # Breakpoint here!
```

272,microsoft/vscode,Task command hangs and doesn't recognize completion of detached processes,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

## Issue

While trying to setup a debugging launch configuration in VS Code, I noticed an issue where the task system hangs indefinitely when using a shell task command that starts a detached process. My setup involved:
- A Docker Compose service with a custom entrypoint script that performs setup tasks (e.g., uv sync) before starting the main process.
- The task shell command I was using: docker compose up -d. This task was used as a preLaunchTask in a launch configuration meant to attach to a python debugger in the running service started by my task, but given the task never completes, the launch configuration never runs.

The issue seems to appear when there's a delay between when the process starts and when it fully detaches. The task system seems unable to recognize that the command has completed, even though the process has been successfully detached (as evidenced by the container running correctly). I'm not sure if the issue is related to vscode getting confused by the process hierarchy or not properly handling compose's detach signal, but either way it seems like Code's task system might be holding onto the process handle or waiting for some specific signal that never comes.

As a workaround, adding a longer delay after docker compose up -d in the task’s command seems to mitigate the issue:
`{ ""command"": ""docker compose up -d && sleep 3"" }`
_Note_: the delay in the task command has to be longer than any delay in the entrypoint script.

## Expected

The task system should handle the container’s initialization period gracefully, even with an entrypoint delay, without requiring explicit workarounds.

## Minimal Repro Steps:

Build the following image, then start a Python Debugger using launch.json. Ensure the service is not up and running before trying to reproduce the hang using the ""Debug using launch.json"" option and selecting ""Python Debugger: Attach"".

- [x] I have searched the existing issues

### Required Troubleshooting Steps

- [x] I have followed these troubleshooting steps
- [x] I have tried both values of the `remote.SSH.useLocalServer` setting [(more info here)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/wiki/Remote-SSH-troubleshooting#troubleshooting-steps)

### Connect Locally

It doesn’t connect successfully (same error message)

### ->

using powershell on windows as shell the generated ssh command is wrong

```
[11:45:24.114] Generated SSH command: 'type ""C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\vscode-linux-multi-line-command-gpuclass-636793360.sh"" | ""C:\Program Files\OpenSSH\ssh.exe"" -D 60261 gpuclass sh'
```

Instead the command should be

```powershell
type ""C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\vscode-linux-multi-line-command-gpuclass-636793360.sh"" | & ""C:\Program Files\OpenSSH\ssh.exe"" -D 60261 gpuclass sh
```

with an `&` before the ssh command otherwise the arguments are not passed correctly

For cmd.exe the generated command is correct

Here is the error I am getting in a terminal with the same command

274,microsoft/vscode,Git Diff Viewer Fails After Updating Images in Markdown Cells,"
## Environment data

-   VS Code Version: 1.95.3 (Universal)
-   Jupyter Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): v2024.10.0
-   Python Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): v2024.20.0
-   OS (Windows | Mac | Linux distro) and version: MacOS, latest 
-   Python and/or Anaconda version: 3.12
-   Type of virtual environment used (N/A | venv | virtualenv | conda | ...): venv

## Expected behaviour

By pasting images into markdown cells, I can embed them.
Here is an example notebook with an embedded image:
https://gist.github.com/kolibril13/6042e1105a6ff415a002aa23f1bd7348

When I replace that image with a new image, that works without problems while editing the notebook in VS Code.
However, as soon as I enter the git diff view, it starts loading the diff forever.
I did not manage to display the proper diff, even after waiting for minutes for the diff.
My assumption is, that VS Code is diffing the actual image string from the metadata:
`""image/png"": ""iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA/oAAAJyCAYAAAB0crugAAAMTmlDQ1BJQ0...`
and not the image itself.

## Actual behaviour

When I replace embedded images, the git diff won't crash.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. add an image (e.g. screenshot, that will be in a .png format).

conhost take precious space in Taskbar & occupy extra slot in Alt+TAB.

`Win+R code Enter` is a fast way to open an editor.

Workaround: instead of running `c:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin\code.cmd` one could utilize `c:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Visual Studio Code\Visual Studio Code.lnk` by pressing `Win c o d e Enter` - basically from the Start menu.

- VS Code Version: 1.95.3
- OS Version: Windows 10 22H2

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a directory `D:\New[folder]`.
2. Open the directory with VSCode.
3. Create a new terminal.
4. The terminal output displays `PS C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0>` instead of `PS D:\New[folder]>`.

I know this was already reported in #70432 and is kinda an external issue, but I believe it can be worked around in VSCode itself. As I can see the PowerShell terminal is created by running the following command ([source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/df74071da5ba92662305adf50ed926370f150d7b/src/vs/platform/terminal/node/terminalEnvironment.ts#L340)):
`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe '-noexit' '-command' 'try { . ""<path-to-the-vscode>\resources\app\out\vs\workbench\contrib\terminal\common\scripts\shellIntegration.ps1"" } catch {}'`
In order to guarantee the expected current directory `Set-Location -LiteralPath '<cwd>'` can be called. Note that each single quote in `<cwd>` must be escaped with two single quotes (`'` -> `''`). Also `'<cwd>'` should be used instead of `""<cwd>""` to avoid escaping of the other special characters used in PowerShell strings.","['bug', 'confirmed', 'terminal-shell-pwsh']",2024-12-01T00:33:55Z,1,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/234935,Dependency Issue

<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->
Add horizontal scrollbar to source control graph in the source control panel. It should probably appear automatically if source control graph content doesn't fit into window, like it does in text editors. `shift+scroll` for horizontal scrolling would also be nice. I checked out source control settings but couldn't find any mention of horizontal scrolling. I also haven't found a similar feature request.

Maybe it won't be useful 99% of the time, but once in a while you get assigned to one of *those* projects...

- VS Code Version: 1.96.0-insider
- OS Version: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (6.8.0-49-generic)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Setup a keybinding for the `git.openFile` command (in this case, it is `ctrl+alt+a`).
   ```json5
   // keybindings.json
   [
     // ...
     {
       ""key"": ""ctrl+alt+a"",
       ""command"": ""git.openFile""
     }
   ]
   ```
2. Open a project with a git repository.
3. Make changes on a file (or a new file).
4. Stage the file.
5. Select the staged file to show the diff view. This should be readonly.
6. Commit the changes.
7. Then, click on the ""Open File"" icon button.
   - This should open the file (writable).
   - The tooltip also shows the keybinding for this action (`ctrl+alt+a` as expected).
8. Going back to the previous tab (the diff view), use the keybinding to open the file.
   - Unexpectedly, this opens a readonly editor even though ""Open File"" must be related to this keybinding because of the tooltip.
   - Using the keybinding on this readonly editor doesn't seem to do anything.

Additionally, the ""Git: Open File"" command is not available in the Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+p`) for both the diff view and the readonly editor, which I assume is `git.openFile`.

As reference, the [GitLens](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens) extension has a `gitlens.openWorkingFile` command that opens writable file from this diff view, similar to the ""Open File"" icon button.","['bug', 'git']",2024-11-28T08:22:50Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/234814,Logical Bug

The length of the array '_recordedInflateBytes' only grows over time and is not released unless the entry process is closed.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In VSCode version 1.94.2 with Remote SSH extension , 
2. disable the 'Use Exec server' option to switch the VSCode server to a WebSocket connection type to reproduce the issue. 
3. Wait for one week and check the entry process.

1. Code Server.
2.  Wait for one week and check the entry process.

Thought?

The recording of inflated bytes results in a memory leak. The Recording inflated bytes is not necessary if the socket will not be sent to ExtensionHost process. The solution is to disable sending the socket to the ExtensionHost process and as a result, the need to write inflated bytes is eliminated. A named pipe can be used to communicate with the ExtensionHost instead of sending a socket.

301,microsoft/vscode,When few QuickPickItems are shown there is not enough contrast in dark mode,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

When a QuickPick menu is shown with a small amount of items (like a true/false or only two options), in dark theme, the second item feels more muted as the background (editor or other thing) isn't enough contrast against the item behind it. Compared to light mode where there is more edges in contrast. 

This was reported by some user studies on our extension, missing seeing the second option.

303,microsoft/vscode,Empty code coverage (vscode development),"I was trying to understand VSCode code structure and testing philosophy, and tried to get code coverage on Linux according to the instructions:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/test/unit/README.md#os-x-and-linux

I got here by following the links in Wiki:

[Writing Tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Writing-Tests) -> [Unit Tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/test/unit/README.md#L1) (in the sentence ""Tests can be run manually on the command line, see the instructions here."")

However I got empty coverage result. It seems that `test.sh` does not have any logic around handling the `--coverage` flag.

My guess is that the instructions are outdated, and manual coverage collection requires a different process?

- VS Code Version: 1.89 -> 1.95
- OS Version: MacOS 14.5

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install vscode, but forget to move it from ""Downloads"" to ""Applications""
2. Vscode will never update automatically, making it fall behind over time.
3. Try to update manually will run into an error (see below)
4. Eventually, extensions installed on remote ssh server (which uses the same version as your local) will start subtly failing, sometimes it simply fails to boot. For example: https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/6710

The current error message:

> Cannot update while running on a read-only volume. The application is on a read-only volume. Please move the application and try again. If you're on macOS Sierra or later, you'll need to move the application out of the Downloads directory. This might mean the application was put on quarantine by macOS. See [this link](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/7426#issuecomment-425093469) for more information.

What needs to be done, specifically, is to move from Downloads to the ""Application"".

# Suggestion

It would be good to update the error message to explicitly say:

> *Move the file ""Visual Studio Code"" from ""Downloads"" to ""Applications""*

The link could be updated to a more relevant link, which explains how to ""unquarantine"" VSCode: https://stackoverflow.com/a/65422671/13837091

That error message could appear as a popup if the extension tries to automatically update but fails. Right now, the popup only appears AFTER you try to manually update with `Code: Check for updates...`.

- VS Code Version: 1.95.3
- OS Version: Sonoma 14.7.1

Steps to Reproduce:

1. The problems decorations in the explorer panel behaves in an inconsistent and erratic way, as shown in the pictures attached. The error decorations (both color and badge) appear and disappear erratically when the file is opened /closed or when its name is selected/deselected in the explorer panel.

2. Errors and warnings are correctly reported and underlined in each file when they are opened.

3. This is observed for all file types (tested on .py, .ipynb, .json, .yaml, .js)

4. If the directory is in a Git repository, the usual decorations for git status (green for unmodified, yellow for modified, etc...) do not appear at all.

5. Problem still occurs with all extensions disabled. I have changed diverse settings such as `""problems.decorations.enabled"": true`, `""explorer.decorations.colors"": true`, without any effect.

- VS Code Version: 1.95.3
- OS Version: Debian 12

Visual glitches appear when using enter/backspace keys to create or delete lines in a document, from lines 2-9.
Also, although inconsistent, switching lines using the mouse is laggy when going to a higher column position on another row (below line 10).
These bugs only appear when the --disable-gpu option is set, or the disable-hardware-acceleration option is true.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VS Code in Debian (KDE Plasma as desktop environment, not sure if relevant) with the following options: --unity-launch --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland --disable-gpu
2. Create a new document
3. Use enter key and backspace key to create/delete lines. Visual glitches with the cursor should appear, and line numbers may not show up.

317,microsoft/vscode,Incorrect Batch Regex Replacement,"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->

## Environment data

-   VS Code version: 1.95.3
-   Jupyter Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): v2024.10.0
-   Python Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): v2024.20.0
-   OS (Windows | Mac | Linux distro) and version: Mac 15.2 Beta (24C5089c)
-   Python and/or Anaconda version: Python 3.12.2 conda 24.9.2
-   Type of virtual environment used (N/A | venv | virtualenv | conda | ...): conda
-   Jupyter server running: Local

## Expected behaviour

When performing a regex-based batch replacement for the pattern `(\d)\+(\d)` with replacement `$1 + $2`, all occurrences across cells should be updated consistently.

Input ipynb JSON:

```json
{
 ""cells"": [
  {
   ""cell_type"": ""code"",
   ""execution_count"": null,
   ""metadata"": {
    ""vscode"": {
     ""languageId"": ""plaintext""
    }
   },
   ""outputs"": [],
   ""source"": [
    ""3+4\n"",
    ""2+3""
   ]
  },
  {
   ""cell_type"": ""code"",
   ""execution_count"": null,
   ""metadata"": {
    ""vscode"": {
     ""languageId"": ""plaintext""
    }
   },
   ""outputs"": [],
   ""source"": [
    ""2+3\n"",
    ""1+2\n"",
    ""0+1""
   ]
  }
 ],
 ""metadata"": {
  ""language_info"": {
   ""name"": ""python""
  }
 },
 ""nbformat"": 4,
 ""nbformat_minor"": 2
}
```

Expected single and batch replacement result:

```json
{
 ""cells"": [
  {
   ""cell_type"": ""code"",
   ""execution_count"": null,
   ""metadata"": {
    ""vscode"": {
     ""languageId"": ""plaintext""
    }
   },
   ""outputs"": [],
   ""source"": [
    ""3 + 4\n"",
    ""2 + 3""
   ]
  },
  {
   ""cell_type"": ""code"",
   ""execution_count"": null,
   ""metadata"": {
    ""vscode"": {
     ""languageId"": ""plaintext""
    }
   },
   ""outputs"": [],
   ""source"": [
    ""2 + 3\n"",
    ""1 + 2\n"",
    ""0 + 1""
   ]
  }
 ],
 ""metadata"": {
  ""language_info"": {
   ""name"": ""python""
  }
 },
 ""nbformat"": 4,
 ""nbformat_minor"": 2
}
```

## Actual behaviour

When performing batch replacement, the second cell’s content is processed incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect update. The output looks as follows:

```json
{
 ""cells"": [
  {
   ""cell_type"": ""code"",
   ""execution_count"": null,
   ""metadata"": {
    ""vscode"": {
     ""languageId"": ""plaintext""
    }
   },
   ""outputs"": [],
   ""source"": [
    ""3 + 4\n"",
    ""2 + 3""
   ]
  },
  {
   ""cell_type"": ""code"",
   ""execution_count"": null,
   ""metadata"": {
    ""vscode"": {
     ""languageId"": ""plaintext""
    }
   },
   ""outputs"": [],
   ""source"": [
    ""3 + 4\n"",
    ""2 + 3\n"",
    ""2 + 3""
   ]
  }
 ],
 ""metadata"": {
  ""language_info"": {
   ""name"": ""python""
  }
 },
 ""nbformat"": 4,
 ""nbformat_minor"": 2
}
```



## Steps to reproduce:

1.	Use the above input ipynb file.
2.	Perform regex replacement with pattern `(\d)\+(\d)` and replacement `$1 + $2` in the Jupyter notebook.
3.	Compare results for single and batch replacement modes.

## Logs

There is no relevant output in the Jupyter panel.

I don’t know whether this is an issue with VS Code or Jupyter, but this kind of error only seems to occur in .ipynb files.","['bug', 'notebook-find']",2024-11-25T09:03:22Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/235754,Logical Bug

320,microsoft/vscode,Poor/pathological multi-cursor performance,"
Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

Using Windows-Alt-down shortcut (Command-Option?) on Mac to extend multi-cursor, after a dozen or so lines vs code totally freezes and must be killed (dialog prompts to reopen window), even though cursor limit is in the thousands (like, 10000).

Debugging, it seems that vs/editor/common/cursor/cursorMoveCommands.ts addCursorDown is generating duplicate cursors for each existing cursor for each down command. E.g. 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16...after extending down to 4 cursors. I imagine this is easily reaching the cursor limit. It makes performing simple edits (delete indents) for more than just a handful of lines impossible.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/8eb7fac5658846e35a0399dc65e9a0580d4e4ed7/src/vs/editor/common/cursor/cursorMoveCommands.ts#L17

```typescript
public static addCursorDown(viewModel: IViewModel, cursors: CursorState[], useLogicalLine: boolean): PartialCursorState[] {
		const result: PartialCursorState[] = [];
		let resultLen = 0;
                 // multiple duplicate cursors added for each action?
		for (let i = 0, len = cursors.length; i < len; i++) {
			const cursor = cursors[i];
			result[resultLen++] = new CursorState(cursor.modelState, cursor.viewState);
			if (useLogicalLine) {
				result[resultLen++] = CursorState.fromModelState(MoveOperations.translateDown(viewModel.cursorConfig, viewModel.model, cursor.modelState));
			} else {
				result[resultLen++] = CursorState.fromViewState(MoveOperations.translateDown(viewModel.cursorConfig, viewModel, cursor.viewState));
			}
		}
		return result;
	}

Can the search bar and the global search bar (and the results) be set to the same monospace font as the workspace?
This is because the content we enter in the search bar is also part of the code itself.

Cheers,

I would like to be able to use git.clean, git.stage and git.unstage while having files selected but not opened in the scm view.
If i rightclick on the selected files and click on discard changes, stash, or press the icons hovering over the files it works fine, but calling the mentioned commands does nothing:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a6d5455-c7c4-48c2-993b-a2bec3615176)

The command seems to only work if i open the tracked file in the scm view but will only run on said file, not taking the other highlightet ones into account.

I use the vim plugin and in the file explorer, e.g., i can highlight files with list.toggle and then delete them with deleteFile and would love to do these git commands aswell without using the mouse.

324,microsoft/vscode,Settings Defaults gets very confused when updating extensions.,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

If the settings schema has changed for an extension during an update, it is not getting correctly detected by VS Code Settings. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install the Code Spell Checker extension version `v3.0.1` (the old version).
   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49753d0b-b964-4331-9099-05ca7aa94d5d)
1. Restart VS Code -- this is necessary if already had the extension installed.
2. Go to the extension's settings.
   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c8a2153-a7ec-40a5-a984-5f6a59e7189a)
1. Notice the list of settings (59) -- Keep settings editor open.
   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aba9949-7fae-4cd9-9576-162266305a55)
1. Update the extension to v4.0.21.
   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ef4827-ad08-443d-8dd0-ad6ec9766fd7)
1. Restart extensions as instructed.
2. Notice the list of settings (59) -- which is incorrect.
   ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2011a3d3-6192-4c3f-9709-68f15d5211c0)
1. Closing the settings editor and reopening doesn't make a difference. It is still showing stale settings.
2. Even Restarting the Extension Host does not work.
3. The only option is to Restart VS Code.
4. Restart VS Code.
5. Go to the Code Spell Checker settings. Notice that there are now 77.

- VS Code Version: 1.95.2
- OS Version: macOS Sequoia

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Write a makefile with a default task like `all:` and a command like `echo hello`.
2. Use VSCode hotkeys to toggle comments on and off for the command.

Expected:

Code comments for make commands begin at the very first column.

Observed:

Code comments try to indent the comment. This disrupts the visual flow of makefiles, and the syntax risks interacting poorly with parsers for various make implementations and shells.","['bug', 'help wanted', 'languages-basic']",2024-11-23T06:53:13Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/234464,Logical Bug

I set `editor.defaultBinaryEditor` setting to an editor provide by an extension(Hex Editor), but I think the problem do not come from the extension.

I'm viewing a log file capture from a serial port. This log file mostly contains readable text content, but some non-text content is also written to the file when the device restarts, which is why I believe VSCode detects this file as a binary file (I have pinpointed the issue to a file segment that includes a \0 terminator). Therefore, VSCode opens this file using the defaultBinaryEditor, which is not a problem for me. I am just trying to use the ""Reopen editor with"" feature to reopen the file in the default text editor.

However, VSCode consistently detects this file as a binary file and attempts to redirect it to the defaultBinaryEditor.

I know I can clear the defaultBinaryEditor or set the default text editor, but this would require me to reselect the hexeditor every time I open a binary file.

I feel that when a binary file is detected, the ""Reopen editor with"" feature should have a higher priority than the defaultBinaryEditor.","['bug', 'custom-editors', 'workbench-editor-resolver']",2024-11-23T03:09:38Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/234461,UI/UX Bug

OS: Darwin arm64 24.1.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the attached TypeScript file in VS Code. Or not, since this site inexplicably won't let me attach the source file. So put the code below in a .ts file and open it in VS Code.
2. Set the default formatter to the built-in JavaScript/TypeScript one.
3. In the formatting settings, have ""format on paste"" off.
4. Select a full `if` statement and right-click, then say ""format selection."" Note that the resulting _indentation_ is correct.
5. Put the insertion point in front of the brace on the first line of the `if` statement and press Return. Note incorrect indentation.
6. Undo that and highlight a whole `if` statement, and then cut it.
7. Paste. Note incorrect indentation of the braces and body. If you turn ""format on paste"" **_on_**, this erroneous pasting behavior stops. But it shouldn't happen with ""format on paste"" **_off_** either, because you're cutting and pasting entire lines, all the way from the left margin. No reformatting is necessary.

I'm not using any third-party formatter. Also, the JavaScript/TypeScript formatting options are being ignored. Screen shot of those options attached too.![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a14ae86-6c18-4d98-9b62-400650ebdd2f)

This page won't let me attach the source file (fix that), so I'll paste its contents here:

	{
        	if (!OTP || (!EMail && !phoneNbr))
        	{
			console.error(""Missing OTP or E-mail & phone number for user verification."");
			return;
        	}

        	// This doesn't preclude sending to both, if we want to someday.
    
        	if(EMail)
       		{
			console.log(`Sending OTP to ${EMail}.`);
		}

		if(phoneNbr)
		{
			console.log(`Sending OTP to ${phoneNbr}.`);
		}
	}
}

export const commMgr = new CommManager();

331,microsoft/vscode,Codes Crashes after about 15 Minutes,"
Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

Hello,
i am trying to code a Pythen Application. But VS Code keeps consinstently crashing after about 15 Minutes. I have a core dump from journalctl. All Extensions (Not the Python ones) are disabled.

Here is the beginning of the Core Dump:

If possible i can send the rest of the dumped Core too.
But this happens at almost exactly 15 Minutes every time.
Last one: Consumed 14min 55.100s CPU time
Before: Consumed 16min 43.285s CPU time.
And before that: Consumed 14min 27.663s CPU time.

If you need more informate i can provide everything you need.
Thanks in advance

### What happened?

When saving the Jupyter notebook for the very first time, if the default filename Untitled.ipynb was erased and then input a new filename without adding the .ipynb, the save notebook function will failed with the following error message.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/493b7dac-53df-46f5-abca-c229c032eb2d)

The save notebook function only works when the word Untitled was removed and only left the .ipynb extension in the save filename dialog box.

333,microsoft/vscode,Task API for `ShellExecutionOptions.env` type does not support `undefined` values,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

The `TerminalOptions.env` API supports environment variable values that include both `string | undefined`.

The ask is for this to match the TerminalOptions API.

Usage:
We plan on using this in the Python extension where users can contribute environment variables via `.env` files. We want to make sure the experience is same for the env variable merge in both cases.

}
```

3. scroll in text editor using mouse wheel

Some time ago disabling smooth scrolling worked as expected, scrolling was instant.

Now scrolling animation exists (which is smooth scrolling in my understanding) no matter the position of setting.

I tried setting window.zoomLevel -1, 0, 1 and 2 without success.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open project from terminal. (logs posted below)
``` zsh
> code --disable-extensions --verbose ./tmp > /data/vscode_logs/1.txt
```
VSCode opens as expected.
2. Attempt to open another project from terminal, while first window is still open.
```zsh
> code --disable-extensions --verbose ./tmp2 > /data/vscode_logs/2.txt
```
Nothing happens, no new window. This has been happening 100% of the time I attempt this. Launching a new window through the GUI works as expected.

Here are the  log files. The first one is the logs written from the start to end time of the second instance.

336,microsoft/vscode,Find & Replace in Files => Very Slow on Mac,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

After recent upgrade it became super slow. I executed ""Find and Replace"" action in files, about 200 files, about 400 replacements, it created many ""rg"" processes on MacOs which slowed Mac for about 5-10 minutes, coplete slowdown!!! It reports that files were processed, but I see ""rg"" processes very long time, not sure, I feel it hangs, I cannot run any Terminal commands for example. Happened few times already.

Thoughts:

1. Why the line about no quick fixes?
2. I was expecting it to look more like deprecated, where there's a yellow underline to be much more obvious about settings that could potentially break the editor.","['bug', 'settings-editor']",2024-11-20T12:21:47Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/234262,UI/UX Bug

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Edit a cell in a notebook (jupyter or polyglot)
2. Type something to let code completion assistant pop up
3. Press **Esc** key to cancel the completion pop up
4. Expected staying focused on currently editing cell, but lost it

Self analysis:

1. There are three shortcuts named ""Notebook: Stop Editing Cell"". All of them are defined by ""System"".
2. Two of them are bound with **Esc** and **Ctrl + Alt + Enter**, and have the condition expression ""inputFocus && notebookEditorFocused && !editorHasMultipleSelections && !editorHasSelection && !editorHoverVisible && !inlineChatFocused"".
3. The rest one is also bound with **Esc**, but has the condition expression ""notebookEditorFocused && notebookOutputFocused"".
4. After removing the shortcut of No.3 above, **Esc** key behaves as expected.

Since these shortcuts are defined by ""System"", suppose this may be a bug?

2. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> -> focus is nicely moved to the pill
3. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> focus moves to the eye
4. Press space on the eye. Focus gets lost ??  Instead focus should stay on the pill
5. Press <kbd>esc</kbd> when focus is on the pill. It should move focus back to chat like find widget does ?? 

In addition we need to make it easier for users to remove / disable items. This can follow the breakpoints pattern.
* When focus is on the pill, <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd> on macOS and <kbd>delete</kbd> on Win and LInux

Fixing this should make it easier for a keyboard centric user to disable / enable attached files. And move focus back to input.

- VS Code Version: 1.95.3
- OS Version: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Close VSCode with 8 projects opened (most of them DevContainer projects)
2. Open VSCode again from terminal ( running `code --disable-extensions --trace-warnings` to disable extensions and to show warning details) without specifying any folder or file (so last working session is used opening the 8 projects)
3. Following log is printed in the terminal:
```bash
Warning: 'trace-warnings' is not in the list of known options, but still passed to Electron/Chromium.

works fine if the notebook document is visible.

Problem happens when user hide their notebook document (such as native REPL) hiding behind some untitled text file, and then calling

```
will create another instance of untitled.ipynb with the same exact URI as the notebook that was hidden.

```sh
$ code --version
1.95.3
f1a4fb101478ce6ec82fe9627c43efbf9e98c813
x64
```
- OS Version: `6.11.3-1-siduction-amd64`

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Extract the reproducing example in [vscodebug.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17791046/vscodebug.tar.gz)
2. The archive contains one git repository called `vscodebug` and the checked out branch should be `feature`. Check out that branch if this is not the case.
3. Open `vscodebug/` in vscode and trust the contents to enable git functionality.
4. Instruct vscode to rebase the current branch (`feature`) onto `main`.
5. There should be a single conflict in `myfile`.
6. Open `myfile` (without using the merge editor) to observe one (and not two) conflicting changes at the beginning of the file: 2x `preamble` versus 1x `preamble`.
7. Now open `myfile` in the merge editor and observe that it still only counts a single conflict (top right status bar of the bottom file view) but also that it highlights the non-conflicting addition of ""new text"" in a similar style to that of the actual conflict.  
8. Click ""Accept all changes from Right"".
9. Observe the addition of ""new text"" being duplicated despite it being exactly the same in both branches and despite it not even being counted as a conflict by vscode itself.

This behavior is highly surprising. I don't see any use for a button that performs the action that vscode performs here. Git users would likely be familiar with `--ours` or `--theirs` but those are exclusive, not additive. I propose that the button be replaced by ""Resolve all conflicts with changes from Right"" which would leave alone those parts that vscode correctly identified as non-conflicting.

There is an additional, related behavior of the merge editor that I have not been able to generate a minimal reproducing example for: it is sometimes the case that in situations such as in `myfile` where `preamble` was accidentally added twice in the rebase's target branch and only once in the current branch, clicking ""Accept all changes from Right"" (i.e. the single addition) actually generates two additions of the line. It seems to me that vscode tries to do something smart by finding the commonalities between the branches (a single addition) but when the button is pressed it interprets it as the user's which to add the line again even though it apparently already part of the code that vscode managed to merge all by itself. I was unable to reproduce this in my example so I cannot demonstrate this easily.","['bug', 'merge-editor']",2024-11-17T15:36:09Z,2,3,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/234032,UI/UX Bug

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use ""Help - Report Issue"".
2. Issue Reporter prompts.

Problems:
* It does not allow user to copy collected information.
* It forces user to fill in title/steps before ""Preview on Github"" is enabled.
* Issue Reporter is unhelpful for writing a bug report, and it does not generate an issue that matches vscode or extension issue template.

Expected Behavior:
- Collected information can be copied.
- ""Preview on Github"" can create a blank issue with correct template.","['bug', 'issue-reporter']",2024-11-16T05:30:59Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233974,UI/UX Bug

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Click CTRL+SHIFT+P.
2. Type and open `Preferences: Open Default Settings (JSON) to open `defaultSettings.json` file.
3. Scroll to the lines 18-23 and look for a table which is not aligned.

Expected result:
For a consistency the table should be as aligned as possible keeping in mind that UTF-8 characters may harden this thing a little.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

Unable to click anything under window, transparent area of aproximately 50px, all around. Since there is a shadow around, every vscode window, issue reporter included, has this issue. I'm guessing it has something to do with the shadow. 

Basically the window is larger then it seems and clicking at the edge of vscode, i'm unable to switch to another app that is underneat it. Representated by white rectangular, aproximation of area around the window.

359,microsoft/vscode,Vscode doesn't respect the login shell on MacOS,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. install and config a miniconda.
2. `brew install xonsh`
3. add `/opt/homebrew/bin/xonsh` to `/etc/shells`
4. on conda base env, run `pip install xonsh`
5. add `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/xonsh` to `/etc/shells`
6. `chsh -s /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/xonsh` to change the login shell
7. reboot
8. open iterm2. the shell is `/opt/homebrew/bin/xonsh`, which shows that the login shell is changed.
9. open vscode. open integrated terminal. the terminal looks like a ""xonsh"", but actually it is `/opt/homebrew/bin/xonsh` instead of the login shell `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/xonsh`

And some tries:
1. I try to `chsh -s /bin/bash`, reboot, and `chsh -s /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/bin/xonsh`. no help.
2. I try to `brew uninstall xonsh`. Then I open vscode terminal. It exits quickly. But the second time I open vscode terminal, It works.
3. I try to remove `/opt/homebrew/bin/xonsh` from `/etc/shells`, reboot. It works.


It seems like vscode deeply relay on /etc/shells to determine which shell to start.

By the way, on MacOS, when I change the login shell, vscode must requires a reboot to notice that the login shell has been changed. This bothers me little because I can accept a reboot. But this time it is a real bug.

1. you will get a false error `')' expected.` from a working code with a regex starting with `<!--`. 
```HTML
<script>
    let a = ""abcdefg"";
    a = a.replace(/<!--/g, """");
</script> 
```

Depending on where and how you use these regex, the false error could be
`')' expected.`, `Expression expected.`, and `Argument expression expected.`.
And I believe there are likely to be more of them.

C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\out directory being deleted nightly for about 2 weeks now. After this happens, open VS Code windows are partially functional but new windows will not open, triggering this error instead.

A JavaScript error occurred in the main process
Uncaught Exception:

To fix it, I end all vscode processes in windows task manager, then re-run installer. I've noticed when closing the processes, there are a few vscode install/uninstall processes running when stuck in this state, so I'm not sure if this is due to some self-update going wrong.

Not sure if this is being caused by a VS code bug or my company's antivirus software. Any help would be appreciated.

369,microsoft/vscode,VSCode trying to update WSL on launch for literally no reason,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Every time I launch VS Code after the latest update, it opens a Terminal.exe that tries to update WSL. I don't have WSL installed at all on my system, and I don't have any exstensions that require or assume WSL to be installed. This is really annoying. Please fix.

```
Windows Subsystem for Linux must be updated to the latest version to proceed. You can update by running 'wsl.exe --update'.
For more information please visit https://aka.ms/wslinstall

Press any key to install Windows Subsystem for Linux.
Press CTRL-C or close this window to cancel.
This prompt will time out in 60 seconds.

Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

When you open the comparison for two files, if these are big and totally different the comparison will start processing but takes long, if you close it and then open another comparison with small files or similar files (that doesn't take long) it will hang, it will take several seconds up to one minute before it finally loads, apparently, the first comparison is frozen in the background still loading even though I already closed it, so it freezes every other comparison until it finishes.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use the following settings:

```json

    ""editor.wordWrap"": ""bounded"",
  },
}
```

2. Open a markdown or plaintext file and type some text. The text won't wrap at 80th column, but wrap at the viewport edge.

Version: 1.94.2 (user setup)
Commit: 384ff7382de624fb94dbaf6da11977bba1ecd427
Date: 2024-10-09T16:08:44.566Z
Electron: 30.5.1
ElectronBuildId: 10262041

Node.js: 20.16.0
V8: 12.4.254.20-electron.0
OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.22631

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  init a directory `A` with git 
2.  Use `ln -s` to build a soft link from `A` to `B`
3.  Use vscode to open folder `B`

If I modify something, I cannot see the built in git plugin work. For example, I cannot see the color bar.

378,microsoft/vscode,Git diff does not work over a Samba share,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I am accessing a network drive on a Linux server, shared using Samba, using the standard GNOME GVfs client. If I navigate to the file share on the terminal (`/run/user/####/gvfs/smb-share:..../`) and run `git diff`, the expected differences are displayed. However, in VS Code, it displays every file as if it is brand new; even worse, staged files won't show anything at all.

### Steps to Reproduce:

Using this settings when opening VSCode with no folder opened in it.
```json
  ""terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows"": ""PowerShell"",
  ""terminal.integrated.env.windows"": {    
    ""PATH"": ""${workspaceFolder}\\node_modules\\.bin;${env:path}""
  },
```
will result:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94f9d274-7a6f-45e2-a832-4d64333baeba)
because `${workspaceFolder}` doesn’t exist.

Using something like `""PATH"": ""c:\\any\\other\\path\\bin;${env:PATH}""` will work fine.

### Suggestion
If `${workspaceFolder}` can not be evaluated, pass it as a string and continue to try to evaluate other variables in `""PATH""`.

381,microsoft/vscode,webviewPanel.viewColumn set incorrectly,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

in an extension, call
```
const webviewPanel=vscode.window.createWebviewPanel(id, title, vscode.ViewColumn.Beside);
```
note that webviewPanel.viewColumn returns undefined

internally the viewColumn is kept as vscode.ViewColumn.Beside = -2, and the accessor returns undefined when it is less than 0.

The documentation for ViewColumn.Beside has this:
A *symbolic* editor column representing the column to the side of the active one. This value can be used when opening editors, but the *resolved* {@link TextEditor.viewColumn viewColumn}-value of editors will always be `One`, `Two`, `Three`,... or `undefined` but never `Beside`.

I accept that it doesn't explicitly mention WebviewPanel, but I think it should be consistent with TextEditor.

383,microsoft/vscode,Terminal Command Truncation,"For a long time, my Visual Studio Code setup, along with its extensions, functioned flawlessly and significantly improved my workflow. However, at some point, I began experiencing issues with certain extensions. Notably, when debugging C++ code with CodeLLDB or CMake Tools, the commands sent to the terminal would occasionally be truncated, preventing the debugger from launching properly.

Recently, I discovered that setting `""terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx"": ""bash""` resolved the issue, while switching back to zsh caused it to resurface. Later, after transferring some conda and jenv initialization settings from `.zshrc` to `.bash_profile`, I found that the problem began to intermittently occur in bash as well. Interestingly, the more configuration scripts I added, the more consistently the issue appeared.

Recognizing a pattern, I decided to investigate further by reviewing discussions and documentation in the project’s GitHub repository.

## Historical Discussions

An issue similar to what I am currently experiencing was first raised back in 2017 as [#38137](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/38137). Although it did not provide a direct solution to my problem and was eventually closed because it could not be reproduced, I would like to acknowledge [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar) for his extensive contributions in that discussion, where he referenced several related issues that offered valuable insights.

One notable comment came from [@fabiospampinato](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/38137#issuecomment-352450960), who mentioned that the command truncation only happens the first time text is sent to the terminal, but works properly afterwards.

The character limit at which commands are truncated seems to vary across different operating systems. According to [#63613](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/63613), commands exceeding 1568 characters are truncated on Windows. Meanwhile, issues such as [#59135](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59135), [#87183](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87183), [#130736](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/130736), and [#134324](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134324) indicate that on macOS, this limit is 1024 characters, which aligns with my observations.

Additionally, issues [#96973](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/96973) and [#61999](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/61999) provided effective testing methods for the ""Run selected text in active terminal"" functionality. Additionally, [#136587](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/136587#issuecomment-966510277) offered an approach for testing using `launch.json`, which significantly simplified my process of reproducing this issue.

I also found the [enable trace logging](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Terminal-Issues#enabling-trace-logging) guide in the project’s wiki, which helped me expedite the process of identifying the cause of the problem.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Modify `~/.zshrc`. The configurations for `oh-my-zsh`, `jenv`, and `conda` can introduce delays during zsh initialization. To simulate this, add a `sleep` command with timestamps for tracking:
```bash
gdate ""+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%3N""
sleep 3
gdate ""+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%3N""
```

2. Configure `settings.json`. Set the terminal settings to use zsh and disable environment inheritance:
```json
{
  ""terminal.external.osxExec"": ""Terminal.app"",
  ""terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx"": ""zsh"",
  ""terminal.integrated.inheritEnv"": false
}
```

3. Set Log Level to Trace.
4. Verify that all Terminal instances are closed to ensure the next session undergoes full `.zshrc` initialization.
5. Create a text file containing a single line exceeding 1024 characters. Below is an example, where the space after `256`marks the 1024-character boundary:
```txt
001 002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009 010 011 012 013 014 015 016 017 018 019 020 021 022 023 024 025 026 027 028 029 030 031 032 033 034 035 036 037 038 039 040 041 042 043 044 045 046 047 048 049 050 051 052 053 054 055 056 057 058 059 060 061 062 063 064 065 066 067 068 069 070 071 072 073 074 075 076 077 078 079 080 081 082 083 084 085 086 087 088 089 090 091 092 093 094 095 096 097 098 099 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257
```

6. Select the entire text and use **Terminal: Run Selected Text in Active Terminal**. Observe that commands beyond 1024 characters, starting from `257`, are truncated.
7. Examine the logs for details on the truncation and potential causes.

## Cross-referencing the code and logs

In the [ptyhost.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17680208/ptyhost.log), I observed the following two log entries. The line:
```log
2024-11-06 22:28:02.211 [trace] node-pty.IPty#write 251 252 253 254 255 256 257
```
is the last time the text I entered appeared in full. This log entry was generated by [this._logService.trace('node-pty.IPty#write', object.data);](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/024999d114e2d9dccd8472a03a17fb0f97c1349e/src/vs/platform/terminal/node/terminalProcess.ts#L522). At this point, the input remains intact. The data is then passed through [this._ptyProcess!.write(object.data);](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/024999d114e2d9dccd8472a03a17fb0f97c1349e/src/vs/platform/terminal/node/terminalProcess.ts#L526C4-L526C41) into the `node-pty` module, where it is further processed by [this._socket.write(data);](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/blob/8bdbd712f40acb939dbab1def8a1c3a815254f74/src/unixTerminal.ts#L178). This method facilitates communication with the C++ layer, which writes the data to the master side of the pseudo-terminal created via [int ret = openpty(&master, &slave, nullptr, NULL, static_cast<winsize*>(&winp));](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/blob/8bdbd712f40acb939dbab1def8a1c3a815254f74/src/unix/pty.cc#L478).

The line:
```log
2024-11-06 22:28:02.211 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 251 252 253 254 255 256 
```
marks the first instance of text truncation. In the `node-pty` project, when the master side of the pseudo-terminal receives data, it triggers the [public get onData(): IEvent<string> { return this._onData.event; }](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/blob/8bdbd712f40acb939dbab1def8a1c3a815254f74/src/terminal.ts#L44) event, allowing subscribed listeners to capture the incoming data. In `vscode`, the `onData` event is subscribed to, and the captured data is logged via [this._logService.trace('node-pty.IPty#onData', data);](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/5cae08d2afa91f2703d1f5f3e4dd8ad358501424/src/vs/platform/terminal/node/terminalProcess.ts#L320).

Notably, I observed two occurrences of the `gdate` timestamp output from `.zshrc` in the `onData` logs:

```log
2024-11-06 22:28:02.153 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 2024-11-06 22:28:02.152
2024-11-06 22:28:05.175 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 2024-11-06 22:28:05.174
```
Additionally, after the shell finished loading `.zshrc`, there was another instance of truncated output:
```log
2024-11-06 22:28:05.229 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 2
2024-11-06 22:28:05.229 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 5
2024-11-06 22:28:05.230 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 5
2024-11-06 22:28:05.230 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData
2024-11-06 22:28:05.230 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 2
2024-11-06 22:28:05.230 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 5
2024-11-06 22:28:05.230 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData 6
2024-11-06 22:28:05.230 [trace] node-pty.IPty#onData
```
Since the pseudo-terminal’s slave side in the `node-pty` project is configured with `ECHO` mode enabled ([`term->c_lflag = ICANON | ISIG | IEXTEN | ECHO | ECHOE | ECHOK | ECHOKE | ECHOCTL;`](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/blob/8bdbd712f40acb939dbab1def8a1c3a815254f74/src/unix/pty.cc#L321)), the echo back at `2024-11-06 22:28:02.211` corresponds to the data being written to the slave's buffer by the master. At this point, the shell on the slave side is still initializing `.zshrc` and has not consumed any data from the buffer.

Once the shell finishes initialization and begins consuming data from the slave's buffer, this data is echoed back to the slave and subsequently captured by the master, triggering the corresponding `onData` events.

## Conclusion

In summary, on my macOS system, the issue of commands exceeding 1024 characters being truncated in the terminal stems from how Visual Studio Code interacts with the pseudo-terminal via `node-pty`. During shell initialization, which involves blocking processes, VSCode continues to write data to the slave side of the pseudo-terminal. Once the buffer reaches its maximum capacity, any additional data is discarded. When the shell resumes, it can only read as much data as fits within the buffer's limit, resulting in truncated commands.","['bug', 'confirmation-pending', 'terminal-process']",2024-11-08T14:43:58Z,3,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233420,Dependency Issue
384,microsoft/vscode,File Search/Replace replacing multiple times (incorrectly) when double-clicking,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

If you click too fast when replacing multiple occurences by clicking the replace button next to each found replacement, a replacements may be done multiple times for the same occurence.

The replace button should be disabled after it is clicked once.

The problem happens more often in big files and with extensions enabled, but it also happens without any extensions.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enter a link in the editor such as `http://duckduckgo.com`
2. Ctrl+Click the link
3. Wrong browser is used to open the link

My default browser is firefox and if if I enter the command `open http://duckduckgo.com` in the terminal, it opens it in the correct firefox window, but vscode uses the wrong browser (opens in chrome). This issue is recent and I've noticed it in v1.95.1, previously it worked fine

If you can provide detail on which mime type the links are using I can further inspect the default application for the mime type, `text/html` is correctly configured on firefox hence not sure where the issue lies. Other applications also open the correct browser and I've only noticed the issue with vscode","['bug', 'linux', 'snap']",2024-11-08T09:18:36Z,6,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/233399,Dependency Issue

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the inline chat (ctrl +I) and sent a prompt that generates edits in multiple hunks
2. Discard one of the hunks

Instead of undoing the previous hunk edit when discarding it, the hunk is still visible and decorated as a diff, see screenshot:

As the screenshot shows, in test explorer, it's expected that the node `MetaAnnotationTest` should have child node. But actual it does not.

While in the editor and test results panel, the test `myFastTest()` is discovered.

During debug, it shows that `myFastTest()`is child of `MetaAnnotationTest`.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1258c90d-4557-4b86-8d5a-4e5786ca3144)

@connor4312 Do you have any idea what could be the reason that the child node is not displayed in the tree view? From my side this behavior happens in a random manner. So far I have no idea how to find the root cause of it.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open VSCode in WSL2
2. Create `foo.ts` and `bar.ts` file
3. Open `foo.ts` file and add  `// file://./bar.ts`
4. Ctrl + Click on file link.

This should take the window to the `bar.ts` file. Instead it's saying

392,microsoft/vscode,Terminal: failed link detection on WSL filesystem when wordSeparators contains slashes,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Add slashes to `""terminal.integrated.wordSeparators""`, e.g. ``"" ()[]{}',\""`?‘’“”|//\\""``
2. Create some files *on a WSL drive*, e.g. `src/foo/bar/bim.ts`, `src/foo/bar/baz.ts`
3. Create a build task that produces filepath-like outputs that should link to those files, e.g.
  ```jsonc
{
	""version"": ""2.0.0"",
	""tasks"": [
		{
			""type"": ""shell"",
			""command"": ""echo $SHELL; echo $0; echo 'Problem: src/foo/bar/xyz.ts'"",
			""problemMatcher"": [],
			""group"": {
				""kind"": ""build"",
				""isDefault"": true
			},
			""label"": ""print a Unixy filepath""
		},
		{
			""type"": ""shell"",
			""command"": ""echo $SHELL; echo $0; echo 'Problem: src\\foo\\bar\\xyz.ts'"",
			""problemMatcher"": [],
			""group"": {
				""kind"": ""build"",
				""isDefault"": true
			},
			""label"": ""print a Windows filepath""
		}
	]
}

  ```
4. Run the task(s)
5. Try to Ctrl-click one of the files (particularly on the directories like `foo`/`bar`).

 
Most likely related to the cause of #179972 or the same issue resurfacing.

393,microsoft/vscode,"The ""Source Control"" panel is often out of sync with my git repo","
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Since upgrading, I've noticed that the ""Source Control"" panel does not stay in sync with my git repo. I find myself invoking ""reload window"" a lot throughout the day to fix the problem. This wasn't an issue before, but now I run into it constantly.

Example repro:
1. Add/modify files (through vscode or externally)
2. Source Control panel updates to show changes
3. Commit (from the command line)
4. Source Control panel still shows modified files until I ""reload window""

396,microsoft/vscode,Emmet wrap with abbreviation reindents content when used with `pre`,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Create a HTML file.
2. Create a deeply nested context (e.g. `div>div>div>code`)
3. Write a piece of code inside `<code>`, with reset indentation.
4. Select the piece of code and use the ""Emmet: wrap with Abbreviation"" command.
5. Enter `pre` as your abbreviation
Exprected behaviour: content inside `pre` maintains reset indentation.
Actual behaviour: content gets reindented.

398,microsoft/vscode,Settings item loses focus unexpectedly,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open settings panel
2. Change some items, like Editor: Font Size ... and wait several seconds
3. The focus will be moved to the next settings item

...

It is very likely to make some error settings if the focus moved unexpectedly. I changed some font settings, this bug let me change the settings very hard and easy to make mistake.

OS: Darwin arm64 24.1.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone the Microsoft VS Code extensions sample - [webview-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/webview-sample) 
2. Replace `src/extension.ts` with:

```
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
	context.subscriptions.push(
		vscode.commands.registerCommand('catCoding.start', () => {
			WebviewIssuePanel.createOrShow(context.extensionUri);
		})
	);
}

class WebviewIssuePanel {
	public static currentPanel: WebviewIssuePanel | undefined;

	public static readonly viewType = 'webviewIssue';

	private readonly _panel: vscode.WebviewPanel;
	private readonly _extensionUri: vscode.Uri;
	private _disposables: vscode.Disposable[] = [];

	public static createOrShow(extensionUri: vscode.Uri) {
		const column = vscode.window.activeTextEditor
			? vscode.window.activeTextEditor.viewColumn
			: undefined;

		if (WebviewIssuePanel.currentPanel) {
			WebviewIssuePanel.currentPanel._panel.reveal(column);
			return;
		}

		const panel = vscode.window.createWebviewPanel(
			WebviewIssuePanel.viewType,
			'Webview Issue',
			column || vscode.ViewColumn.One,
			{
				enableScripts: true,
				enableFindWidget: true,
				localResourceRoots: [vscode.Uri.joinPath(extensionUri, 'media')],
			}
		);

		WebviewIssuePanel.currentPanel = new WebviewIssuePanel(panel, extensionUri);
	}

	public static revive(panel: vscode.WebviewPanel, extensionUri: vscode.Uri) {
		WebviewIssuePanel.currentPanel = new WebviewIssuePanel(panel, extensionUri);
	}

	private constructor(panel: vscode.WebviewPanel, extensionUri: vscode.Uri) {
		this._panel = panel;
		this._extensionUri = extensionUri;

		this._panel.title = 'Webview Issue';
		this._panel.webview.html = this._getHtmlForWebview(this._panel.webview);

		this._panel.onDidDispose(() => this.dispose(), null, this._disposables);
	}

	public dispose() {
		WebviewIssuePanel.currentPanel = undefined;
		this._panel.dispose();

		while (this._disposables.length) {
			const x = this._disposables.pop();
			if (x) {
				x.dispose();
			}
		}
	}

	private _getHtmlForWebview(webview: vscode.Webview) {
		// Use a nonce to only allow specific scripts to be run
		const nonce = getNonce();

		return `<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html lang=""en"">
			<head>
				<meta charset=""UTF-8"">

				<!--
					Use a content security policy to only allow loading images from https or from our extension directory,
					and only allow scripts that have a specific nonce.
				-->
				<meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""default-src 'none'; style-src ${webview.cspSource}; img-src ${webview.cspSource} https:; script-src 'nonce-${nonce}';"">

				<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">

				<title>Webview Issue</title>
			</head>
			<body>
				Text to search for
			</body>
			</html>`;
	}
}

function getNonce() {
	let text = '';
	const possible = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
	for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
		text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));
	}
	return text;
}
```

4. Start the sample and run `Cat Coding: Start cat coding session`
5. Use Ctrl-F to search for `text`, you will see it correctly highlighted:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/122b156d-0c0b-4795-abef-01586b6347a4)

6. Run `View: Move Editor Group into New Window` command to open the webview in a new window
7. Use Ctrl-F to search for `text`, you will see it does not highlight:

402,microsoft/vscode,pytest parametrize test results are hard to read,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

<!-- Please fill in all XXX markers -->
# Behaviour

With parametrized tests, the results are hard to read in the ""running tests for ..."" right side window of test results.  
For non-parametrized tests, the test name is listed.  
For parametrized tests, the parameters are listed without the test name.  
I think it would be easier to read if it was ""test_name[param_value]"", similar to how `pytest -v` shows the results.

## Steps to reproduce:

Run a test with parametrizations.  
Here's a small example: 
```python
import pytest

def test_a_1():
    ...

def test_a_2():
    ...

@pytest.mark.parametrize('x', [1, 2])
def test_b(x):
    ...
```

I'm attaching a screen shot of the output to demo the issue. 
In this example I think ""test_b[1]"" and ""test_b[2]"" would be easier to read than ""[1]"" and ""[2]"".
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e0cb73c-fe25-4076-8d32-eeb381829f7a)


The problem is more pronounced with a parametrized fixture.  
Example: 
```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(params=[1, 2])
def x(request):
    return request.param

def test_a(x):
    ...

def test_b(x):
    ...
```

Results in:

I am writing an extension that uses the theme color `editorGhostText.foreground`, and I would expect it to be visible in all built-in themes. However their values are transparent when I switch theme to either `Dark High Contrast` or `Light High Contrast`. I found they are explicitly set as such [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e37672f7d7a7e55064cad4d0b11e88f8d92ba7ac/src/vs/editor/common/core/editorColorRegistry.ts#L67), curious why.","['bug', 'ghost-text']",2024-11-04T13:32:17Z,1,2,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/232970,UI/UX Bug

408,microsoft/vscode,DONT auto list all sub-directory during selecting folder in Remote connection,"When attempting to connect to a remote machine project located at /dev/shm/xxx/yyy/zzz, entering the full path still results in listing each sub-folder sequentially—first in /dev, then /dev/shm—instead of directly opening the specified path. This causes significant delays and, in some cases, a crash.

The current design, where only Open Folder is available in Remote, is not particularly user-friendly and could be further optimized.

A straightforward solution would be to add a Search Folder option that functions like Open Folder but retains auto-listing. Meanwhile, the existing Open Folder option should disable auto-listing for a faster, more efficient experience.

- VS Code Version: 1.96-insiders
- OS Version: Windows/Linux (Tested locally and in Codespaces)

## Reproduction
Start codespace on https://github.com/JustinGrote/vscode-extension-issues/tree/issue/logAppendOrder and `Run Extension [Isolated Profile]`
[Relevant Code](https://github.com/JustinGrote/vscode-extension-issues/blob/issue/logAppendOrder/src/extension.ts)

## Expected
Logs appear in the order they are sent
```
Log1
Log2
Log1
```

## Actual
Second Log1 appears before log2, presumably because it is ""warmed up""

## Notes
If this is expected behavior, it should be documented in `vscode.d.ts` because it can lead to out-of-order logs. 

Further, if multiple instances of an output channel of the same name is unsupported, it should also be documented as such or better, provide an exception on creation.","['bug', 'output']",2024-11-01T20:29:05Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/232864,Logical Bug

- VS Code Version: 1.96-insiders
- OS Version: Windows/Linux (Tested locally and in Codespaces)

## Reproduction
1. Start this branch in Codespaces and use Launch task Run Extension [Isolated Profile]
https://github.com/JustinGrote/vscode-extension-issues/tree/issue/logOutputWindowTraceChange
1. Change log level to something other than info
1. Choose ""Restart Extension Host""

Relevant Code:
https://github.com/JustinGrote/vscode-extension-issues/blob/issue/logOutputWindowTraceChange/src/extension.ts

## Expected
A `LogOutputChannel` starts with the `logLevel` that the user preference has specified

## Actual
Always starts at `Info` and gets set sometime later, however logs seem to filter normally. 

EDIT: This only happens if the default log level and the output pane log level are not the same, and ""Set as Default"" has not been used to modify the `argv.json`. If default log level and output pane log level are the same, the ondidChange does not fire later and the startup log level is correct.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7e53748-d024-40cf-a8cb-b47eb7418a0d

## Relevance
I have a custom logger that relies on checking the logLevel and do a noop if it does not meet the required level.



## Potential Fixes
- Update the property before processing any further log calls
- Provide a promise that can be awaited for when the LogOutputChannel is ready to receive logs at the user preferenced log level.
- I considered waiting for an onDidChangeLogLevel but this does not trigger if the user preference specified `info`, so a spurious onDidChangeLogLevel for info as well would also suffice.","['bug', 'log']",2024-11-01T20:07:39Z,1,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/232862,Logical Bug

- VS Code Version: v1.95.1
- OS Version: Fedora 41 (GNOME)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Connect 2 DP monitors to your system
2. Open VS Code on primary screen
3. Change the scaling on the second screen

VSCode detects this change but it doesn't respect the monitor this update was intended for. Sometimes this also results in a broken window where the window size did not update but the content did scale. If this happens you get a window where the content is zoomed and you have no window decorations as they where also scaled. So you only option is to alt+f4 and restart vscode.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Create a file:
    ```
    left
                                  ignoreCase:
                                    description: |-
                                      IgnoreCase specifies that string matching should be case insensitive.

2. Create a file:

                                  ignoreCase:

    ```
3. Select the left tab and then shift click to select the right tab

4. Right click a tab 
5. Choose `Compare Selected`
6. Turn on word-wrap

### Actual Results 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93ae30f6-9684-42d8-afe6-eed7ca26d57e)

(Note that the picture has the files detected as Markdown, but changing them to YAML results in the same behavior as long as word-wrap is turned back on...)

### Expected Results

The wrap column should match for both sides (offhand, I prefer the right side)

416,microsoft/vscode,Toggling views/panels has inconsistent focus behaviour,"While investigating https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/198293 I noticed that our action to toggle visibility of primary or secondary side bar or panel has inconsistent behaviour when it comes to passing focus to the view that becomes visible or not.

Notice when the explorer is active how focus remains in the editor:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a18f64dd-6d9c-4def-b62d-26ad32d14810)

And now with the SCM view:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de572695-04b1-4333-ae7c-cc2e06325caa)

First of all, these actions seem to call into methods to toggle visibility of the container via layout service which eventually calls into `openPaneComposite`, e.g. for the primary sidebar:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4520d915c98954dc96dd0bc00b8bb68181cbf2b6/src/vs/workbench/browser/layout.ts#L1750

The last parameter is a `true` to indicate that focus should move to that pane.

However, at the point where we want to focus the pane, it is not yet visible because the grid only updates a few lines below:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/4520d915c98954dc96dd0bc00b8bb68181cbf2b6/src/vs/workbench/browser/layout.ts#L1756

Any view that implements `focus` by e.g. focussing the list will be a no-op because the DOM nodes are not yet visible. The SCM view is probably a bit async and that is why it works by chance.

I am actually not sure how to address this: people might have gotten used to the fact that these commands typically preserve focus for most of our views. I still think that the implementation is currently buggy around focussing the pane when the container becomes visible, so maybe a fix would need to be:
* handle focus properly after the container in the grid is visible
* make focus more explicit so that the toggling actions can explicitly pass in `focus: false` to preserve todays behaviour

417,microsoft/vscode,Pytest Test Discovery Issue in Multi-root Workspace with Folder-specific Settings,"I'm encountering an issue with Pytest test discovery in a multi-root workspace setup in Visual Studio Code. My workspace includes two folders: api and authorizer. Each folder contains its own set of tests within a tests subdirectory.

For each folder, I have a settings.json file located in the .vscode directory with the following configuration:

{
    ""python.testing.pytestArgs"": [
        ""tests""
    ],
    ""python.testing.unittestEnabled"": false,
    ""python.testing.pytestEnabled"": true,
    ""python.envFile"": ""${workspaceFolder}/tests/dev.env""
}

Despite this setup, when I open the Testing tab in VSCode, the paths to the test files are incorrect. The tests directory is missing from the paths, resulting in errors such as:

CRIT pytest at 'authorizer': Execution of the test ""....../authorizer/application/test_authorizer_token.py"" failed: Error: Process exited with code 4: ERROR: file or directory not found: ....../authorizer/application/test_authorizer_token.py

The correct path should be:
....../authorizer/tests/application/test_authorizer_token.py

I've ensured that each folder has its own .vscode/settings.json with the correct pytestArgs, and I've tried using absolute paths as well. All extensions and VSCode itself are up to date.

Has anyone experienced a similar issue or have any suggestions on how to resolve this path resolution problem?

Thank you!

420,microsoft/vscode,Add Cell toolbar remains sticky in blank notebook,"### Applies To

- [x] Notebooks (.ipynb files)
- [ ] Interactive Window and\/or Cell Scripts (.py files with \#%% markers)

### What happened?

1. Create a new blank notebook (with no cells at all)
2. Open that blank notebook
3. Notice that the Add Cell toolbar is available without hovering (expected would be that this is only available on hover)
4. Add a few cells
5. Notice that the Add Cell toolbar at the top of the notebook remains sticky and is still available without hovering

422,microsoft/vscode,Cut/paste broken for CodeMirror editor in extension webview after updating VSCode,"Type: <b>Bug</b>

- Create an extension using a webview that mounts a CodeMirror editor.
- Cut/paste doesn't work, though they do in version 1.94.
- Paste events are not emitted for CodeMirror's contenteditable div.

Strangely enough, duplicating the div or making another contenteditable div works. CodeMirror seems mostly event driven, so I tried to receive paste events by deleting existing event handlers, but didn't get anywhere. I'm hoping someone knows what changed inside VSCode to treat this situation differently.

Here's a simple **[example extension](https://github.com/canislupaster/codemirror-vscode-extension-sample)** based off the Cat Coding webview sample. Thank you for reading.

- Opened a new insiders.vscode.dev window enabled settings sync

- Opened new insiders.vscode.dev window to connect to tunnels using MSFT account.
?? I was asked to sign in to sync settings
- In the first window, I connected to azure repo

I can repro this. The interesting thing is that it seems like we do return a valid Settings Sync token... so I wonder if this is maybe something similar to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/229456

## Background

The Biome VS Code extension guides users to add `quickfix.biome` to `editor.codeActionsOnSave` to fix issues when saving files.

- https://biomejs.dev/reference/vscode/#fix-on-save

However, enabling this setting causes saving `*.ts` files to be delayed by about 500ms.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc8f4134-2422-411d-9691-1e658e62627b

Surprisingly, this delay occurs even if the Biome extension is not installed. Additionally, disabling the built-in VS Code extension `typescript-language-features` eliminates the delay. For details of the issue and reproduction steps, please see the following comment:

- https://github.com/biomejs/biome-vscode/issues/229#issuecomment-2356257770

## Cause of the delay

As a result of my investigation, I found that the delay is caused by the following code in `typescript-language-features`:

- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/684f9d47a4a97d7ea747915f4d1595f86f98aaad/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/languageFeatures/quickFix.ts#L254-L256

When `typescript-language-features` receives a `quickfix` code action, it attempts to automatically fix some diagnostics. The execution process is as follows:

1. Receive a `quickfix` code action.
2. Check if there are diagnostics in the open file. If not, exit.
3. Wait for 500ms.
4. Retrieve diagnostics again.
5. Automatically fix any fixable diagnostics obtained in step 4.

The 500ms wait is because the diagnostics obtained in step 2 might be outdated. If this wait time is removed, code fixes might be performed based on old diagnostics. To prevent this, `typescript-language-features` waits for 500ms.

Furthermore, `typescript-language-features` does not only respond to the `quickfix` code action. It responds to all code actions that start with `quickfix`, such as `quickfix.biome` and `quickfix.some-name`. Therefore, adding `quickfix.biome` to `editor.codeActionsOnSave` slows down the saving of `*.ts` files.

As an experiment, I commented out [the line that waits for 500ms](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/684f9d47a4a97d7ea747915f4d1595f86f98aaad/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/languageFeatures/quickFix.ts#L254-L256) and rebuilt vscode, and the saving of `*.ts` files became faster.

## Questions

I have several questions regarding this delay issue.

### Q1. Is it acceptable to add `quickfix` or `quickfix.biome` to `editor.codeActionsOnSave`?

In the first place, does VS Code intend for `quickfix` or `quickfix.biome` to be added to `editor.codeActionsOnSave`? Neither `quickfix` nor `quickfix.biome` are included among the completion items for `editor.codeActionsOnSave`.

<img width=""592"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54430320-098b-48ee-b4eb-9512d3df9d2b"">

Is this because adding `quickfix` or `quickfix.biome` to `editor.codeActionsOnSave` is not intended? Should the Biome extension use `source.fixAll.biome` instead of `quickfix.biome`?

### Q2. Is it okey for `typescript-language-features` to react to `quickfix.biome`?

This delay occurs because `typescript-language-features` is reacting to `quickfix.biome`. I feel that `typescript-language-features` is overly sensitive to code actions. Is this the intended behavior?

Should `typescript-language-features` be modified to react only to `quickfix` and `quickfix.ts`?

### Q3. Is it okay that the `source.fixAll.ts` code action does not wait for 500ms?

In the `quickfix` code action, there is a 500ms wait, but in the `source.fixAll.ts` code action, this does not occur.

- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/684f9d47a4a97d7ea747915f4d1595f86f98aaad/extensions/typescript-language-features/src/languageFeatures/fixAll.ts#L211-L220

Therefore, in the `source.fixAll.ts` code action, there is a possibility that code fixes are performed based on old diagnostics. Is this the intended behavior?

When accessing Settings, I get the error:

Tried reporting this using 'Report Issue' from the 'Help' menu, as recommended by the template. Getting the same error again.

Launched with `code --disable-extensions`, the same problems.

432,microsoft/vscode,Terminal Cursor is at the wrong place with Python3.13,"
The terminal cursor seems to consistently be at wrong (further in the line) place, when user tries to use python3.13 inside the terminal:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59081356-6531-4eac-b4a7-f73794ccf428)

I think it is VS Code thing, since the cursor seems ""normal"" for external terminal and Pycharm.

- OS Version: 

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set WSL2 default shell (Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS) to something other than Bash. [I primarily use non-POSIX shells like Fish, Nushell, and Elvish.]
2. Enable Remote Tunnel with Microsoft account on Windows 11 with WSL2.
3. Sign in to Microsoft account on vscode.dev, connect to Remote Tunnel, see that you can open folders and edit files from the Windows filesystem as expected.
4. Select Connect to WSL from the Command Palette, watch VSCode attempt to install/start the remote code server instance.
5. Watch the crashloop begin: ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e799b77-e8ac-4a77-9250-df8be4ac91dc)

The error in the attached screenshot is effectively fatal, reloading the window over and over.
6. Close the tab.
7. Change the default shell for WSL2 to Bash (or possibly some other POSIX-compliant shell).
8. Reopen vscode.dev, connect to Remote Tunnel, Connect to WSL, watch the remote server installation succeed, then verify that you can open directories and edit files as expected.

I'm not sure what's going on behind the scenes with that code server install, but since launching `code` from WSL2 in any of the non-POSIX shells I use works just fine (i.e., delete `~/.vscode-server`, launch `code`, watch the magic happen), it suggests an assumption that the default shell will be Bash (or at least something POSIX-compliant) for the installation and connection via Remote Tunnel.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/715f285a-5be9-442b-9c65-68abc6bb5c1c)


Steps to Reproduce:

1. setup exploration and insiders build to use settings sync
2. in insiders have chat in the aux bar, close aux bar
3. in exploration move chat into primary bar and trigger sync
4. in insiders wait for sync to apply and open aux bar

=> aux bar appears empty even though it has a view

I think here our logic for falling back to another ""default"" view is not picking up the other view that is there.

Note: the view in aux bar is registered based on a condition that evaluates late, so its possible this would not happen if the view was there on startup ??

439,microsoft/vscode,terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled causes terminal to become progressively unresponsive,"Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

- Press command-j to open the terminal.
- Type a command that outputs 10000 lines of text, for instance:
```
python -c ""for i in range(10000): print(f'This is a long long long long long line of text {i}')""
```
- Press the up arrow to display the previous long command at the shell prompt in the terminal and then hold the backspace key to delete this new command entirely without executing it.

Observed: the cursor progresses very slowly to the left and becomes almost stuck with very high CPU usage when holding the backspace key.

Workaround: setting `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled` to `false`, and starting a new `zsh` shell (even without terminating the previous shell) makes the terminal responsive again.

I am using the zsh shell with some custom prompt and other zsh custom config.

440,microsoft/vscode,All <span> tags in hover have a 4px bottom margin which causes nested spans to have stacking bottom margins,"Type: <b>Bug</b>

When an extension provides a hover using the `HoverProvider.provideHover` API, and the hover contains Markdown with HTML in it, every span gets a 4px bottom margin. This was added in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/107442 due to  https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/issues/1937 

This means that nested spans will get stacking margins, and vertically stacked spans will have gaps between them which may be undesirable depending on how the author of the extension wants to style the hover.

Because of the (understandably) restrictive CSS allowed in `markdownRenderer.ts`, we cannot remove this bottom margin. 

I would consider the stacking margins with nested spans to be a bug, because nested spans may be required to do certain types of styling of text and it does not seem correct for that to cause the margin to expand with each level of nesting.

Demonstration of problem:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56ef4a6b-6951-4c61-87af-a8d34d261abc)

To reproduce this:
1. build and install the extension at https://github.com/navtej-ac/vscode-hover-sample-extension ... It is based on the Hello World Minimal Sample from the `vscode-extension-samples` repo.
2. With the extension installed, activate it by running the ""Hello World"" command 
3. Then hover on any line the text editor. On every other line we show the hover with background colors and demonstrate both the gap between spans and the background color and the stacking of margins. On the remaining lines we try to show a hover with `margin:0` added to the spans' styling, which causes the HTML sanitizer to strip the styles

Expected: spans with background colors can nest without the outer span increasing in height and spans with backgrounds do not have a vertical gap between them.

Actual: nested spans all have 4px margins which accumulate and vertically stacked spans have a gap between them.

Proposed Fix: Add `margin:0` to the list of allowed styles in `markdownRenderer.ts`.

- VS Code Version: 1.92.0 (Commit: b1c0a14de1414fcdaa400695b4db1c0799bc3124)
- OS Version: Rocky Linux 8.5

The `check-requirements-linux.sh` script that runs as part of a devcontainer setup wants to parse the OS version from `/etc/os-release`.
That file ""is a newline-separated list of environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments"" (see `man os-relase` on Linux).
The script tries to parse the value it wants [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/resources/server/bin/helpers/check-requirements-linux.sh#L34), by running:

```
OS_ID=""$(cat /etc/os-release | grep -Eo 'ID=([^""]+)' | sed -n '1s/ID=//p')""
```

This looks for a key-value pair of the form `ID=value` and strips out the `ID=` part.
It assumes the pair is not of the form `ID=""value""`, which appears to be permitted by the file format, and appears in the wild in Rocky 8.5 where the relevant line reads:

```
ID=""rocky""
```

In that case the `grep` command will fail to match the line and the value of `OS_ID` will be empty, resulting in a non-zero exit code of 1.

This could be fixed by changing the variable assignment to:

```
OS_ID=$(source /etc/os-release && echo $ID)
```

This will run a subshell in which the values in the file get assigned to environment variables, which removes any surrounding `""` marks.
Since this runs in a subshell the current shell's environment will not pick up these variables.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Start a devcontainer built from Rocky 8.5.

- VSCode Version: 1.94.2
- Local OS Version: Flatpak Freedesktop SDK runtime 24.08
- Remote OS Version: not relevant, we're talking about a local terminal outside of the container
- Remote Extension/Connection Type: Containers

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Add some configuration to the project's `.vscode/settings.json` that touches the terminal. In my case the following to launch a shell on my host outside of the Flatpak sandbox or container:
```json
{
    ""terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux"": ""bash"",
    ""terminal.integrated.profiles.linux"": {
        ""bash"": {
            ""path"": ""/app/bin/host-spawn"",
            ""icon"": ""terminal-bash"",
            ""args"": [""fish""],
            ""overrideName"": true
        }
    }
}
```
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + P and type `Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal (Local)` to open a local terminal outside of the container

In my case this _should_ open the Fish shell on my host, and if I run the project outside of devcontainers this works as expected. However when the project is opened within a container and I open a local integrated terminal this is completely ignored and I get a `/bin/sh` shell (which is the default within Flatpak). It also suddenly complains about ""bash"" not being a valid option for `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux`.

Yes I am running through Flatpak to make things complicated but I don't see how this has anything to do with that environment, this would just as well not work outside of it.

443,microsoft/vscode,Shortcuts for auto indentation not working,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

I want to use the command `Reindent Selected Lines` or `Reindent Lines` with a shortcut. I tried setting keybindings to each of them (`Ctrl+Shift+Tab` and `Alt+I`, respectively), but when I press them in notebooks or scripts (using Python), nothing happens and the indentation is not corrected.

I have the _Black Formatter_ extension for Python. I know there is the `Format Selection` command but that changes the code too much for my liking. I only want to have things properly aligned/indented.

How can I make this shortcut work in notebook cells and scripts?

445,microsoft/vscode,Git - diff view does not work for PDF files,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a Git repository and put a PDF file into it.
2. Commit the PDF file.
3. Change the PDF file.
4. Repeat 2. and 3.
5. In the _Source Control_ view, click the PDF filename.
6. Click _Open Anyway_ and select the default text editor.
7. Two columns open that should show the old and the new version of the PDF. However, only the new version on the right is displayed correctly. On the left, only one character (``, reads like `FF`) is displayed. (The two PDF file versions are almost identical in my example.)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/409676dd-1649-4ccb-941d-56bac5d935d3)
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab285c16-0bb4-4f64-954f-dc7b72d4ba70)

8. Now, in the _Source Control Graph_, click the second commit from 4.
9. This time, Both sides of the diff only show the character from before.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50c510e4-2599-45fd-b4f1-6062a7763277)

It seems like the wrong content is shown for PDFs that are not currently checked out.

----

Note: In practice, one would usually not look at PDFs like this, of course. One would use a PDF viewer extension. However, this bug causes the PDF viewers to also fail to show the old versions as described e.g. in https://github.com/tomoki1207/vscode-pdfviewer/issues/70, since they do not receive the correct PDF. The steps above show that the issue does not lie with the extensions.

On macOS with Apple Intelligence enabled, most third-party applications display the ""Writing Tools"" menu option in the edit menu, providing writing suggestions and proofreading options. For those writing documentations in vscode, enabling this menu could prove beneficial.

Type: <b>Bug</b>

If you use ALT-Down or Alt-Up on number pad to create a multi-line cursor, the editor displays an alt character for each line that the cursor extends into once the keys are relased.   This only occurs when you use the number pad arrow keys.  It does not occur when you use the dedicated arrow keys on the keyboard.

452,microsoft/vscode,VS Code installation corrupts when update comes during running WSL session,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Issue:
When VS Code is running, it is connected to WSL and update comes - installation is being corrupted.
Repro steps:
- Install VS Code using system installer (not tested for user installer)
- Open directory in WSL (tested against WSL2)
- Wait for update to come out (issue appears even with disabled auto-update)
- Try to open another instance of VS Code - it should be broken for both Windows and WSL environments
Workarounds:
- Use system installer to make new installation ""on top"" of existing one
- Try to catch update without opened WSL environment - when only Windows directories are opened update goes smoothly
- You can use old system installer and then update VS Code from Help menu with only Windows directories opened - it also works

VS Code version: Code 1.94.2 (384ff7382de624fb94dbaf6da11977bba1ecd427, 2024-10-09T16:08:44.566Z)

- VS Code Version: VS Code 1.94.2 (Also reproduced on VSCodium 1.94.2)
- OS Version: Fedora Linux 40 (Workstation Edition), Gnome (46), Wayland

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Create a `test.ts` file
2.  Enable typescript.inlayHints.functionLikeReturnTypes
3. Write:
```
function foo(){
    return Date.now();
}
```
4. Change to: (adding a whitespace between `foo()` and `{`)
```
function foo() {
    return Date.now();
}
```
5. During the change you will see a small flicker of the inlay hint: going from ` : number ` to ` : numbe...` to ` : number` again.

This flickering behavior isn't very elegant, and also happens with other languages, for example with Python (and the basedpyright extension, see https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/issues/794)","['bug', 'inlay-hints']",2024-10-19T14:09:43Z,8,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/231728,UI/UX Bug

# The issue description (system details at the bottom):

Seems like even though it says that nushell is supported now in VSCode in August release ([**here**](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_terminal) is the announce), it still can't be used as one of Internal Terminals when you try to debug python script. It gets call with a sequence not compatible with nushell syntax like this one.

a) Pixi's environemnt python bad command example:
```
cmd /C ""c:\dev\data_processing\.pixi\envs\default\python.exe c:\Users\360ci\.vscode\extensions\ms-python.debugpy-2024.12.0-win32-x64\bundled\libs\debugpy\adapter/../..\debugpy\launcher 54917 -- c:\dev\data_processing\test.py ""
```
b) Conda's environment python bad command example:
```
c: && cd c:\dev\sfms && cmd /C ""c:\programs\miniconda\envs\data_proc\python.exe c:\Users\360ci\.vscode\extensions\ms-python.debugpy-2024.12.0-win32-x64\bundled\libs\debugpy\adapter/../..\debugpy\launcher 50270 -- c:\dev\sfms\test.py ""
```
Screenshot:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14e504d5-dcb7-4ecc-ad7d-6f6af1c904fb)

It DOES work when you just try to run the script because comparing with debug sequence it doesn't have nushell incompatible command in this case. Because when you try to just run it correctly forms the line. Here is example of the command which works

Conda's good and compatible command when you just run without debugger:
```
C:/programs/miniconda/envs/data_proc/python.exe c:/dev/sfms/test.py
```

@anthonykim1, I saw you latest work on having nushell and julia integrated into VSCode, but I think there is a small chance that I misunderstand how it is expected to work?

The isssue is also discussed here in nushell repo:
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/14022
Here is also one of my comments on this problem with some advices from one of the authors:
https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/2775#issuecomment-2412005812

@IanManske point outed [here](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/14022#issuecomment-2403325882
) that the problem in these lines where nushell is not supported:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/321e1e5b8a0af43a0ee7549713f606936a1ac9ac/src/vs/workbench/contrib/debug/node/terminals.ts#L81

# Details

- VS Code Version: 1.94.2
- OS Version: Win10: 10.0.19045 Build 19045
- Plugins: Python plugin, but no nushell plugin (is it needed?)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install nushell in your system.
2. Go to Settings, to to Terminal > Integrated > Default Profile: Windows, set up ""path"" to installed nushell
3. Have a small python program like ```print(""Hello nu in vscode"")```
4. Click on the ""Run"" arrow, selecting ""Python Debugger: Debug Python File""
5. Get error message caused by ill-formed command ```Error:   × Invalid literal``` complaining (see the above the full command it calls) about ""\"" or ""&&"" symbols in the string.","['bug', 'debug']",2024-10-17T13:08:28Z,1,6,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/231583,Dependency Issue

Version: 1.94.1 (Universal)
Commit: e10f2369d0d9614a452462f2e01cdc4aa9486296
Date: 2024-10-05T05:44:32.189Z
Electron: 30.5.1
ElectronBuildId: 10262041
Chromium: 124.0.6367.243
Node.js: 20.16.0
V8: 12.4.254.20-electron.0
OS: Darwin arm64 24.0.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Subscribe to `debug.onDidTerminateDebugSession` and `debug.onDidChangeActiveDebugSession`
2. Start two debug sessions.
3. Click on the second one in the call stack view to make it active.
4. Press terminate on the second session via the popup button in the call stack view

Correctly receive the `terminate` event but not always a `active session changed` event.

When the second session is killed, the UI correctly reverts to show the state of the first session - so it is now de facto the active one. E.g. variables and buttons update. The combo box in the toolbar updates to reflect the only remaining session (but doesn't disappear, despite there being only one session to show).

It causes us a problem as we have our own custom debug type and a UI panel that we update to reflect the active debug session, showing a diagram relevant to the active session (if one of ours). When the second session is terminated and the first one becomes active by default, we should update the UI as well, but we don't get the event. And because the vscode UI has de facto changed to have the first one active (but without firing an event), there isn't anything the user can do that will trigger that event to fire.

I'm running our extension from vscode in the extension host.

461,microsoft/vscode,VSCode is taking too long to execute first python test,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

VSCode takes too long to execute first python test after refreshing the tests. This time increases quadratically with the number of tests in working directory. A side effect of this is that in repos with large number of tests especially parametrized tests, it drives the CPU consumption of extension host process to 100% and causes VSCode window to freeze. It only works again after reloading the window.

|Number of tests|Time taken to run first test (s)
|---|---|
|10000|8.6|
|20000|14.1|
|30000|46.1|
|40000|94.6|
|50000|194.5|
|60000|344.3|

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/361c850f-51f7-43eb-ad64-82eab0996883)

Note that the time taken by the run_adapter script to discover tests is proportional to the number of tests so this issue is in the VSCode UI itself.

<b>Reproducer</b>

Workspace settings:
```
{
    ""python.testing.pytestEnabled"": true,
    ""python.testing.cwd"": ""src/python"",
}
```
Directory structure:
```
.
??? src
    ??? python
        ??? __pycache__
        ?   ??? test_example.cpython-311-pytest-7.4.3.pyc
        ?   ??? test_sample.cpython-311-pytest-7.4.3.pyc
        ??? test_example.py
        ??? test_sample.py

```
`test_example.py` contains:
```
import pytest

count = 10000

@pytest.mark.parametrize(""x"", [i for i in range(count)])
def test_parametrize(x):
    pass

```
`test_sample.py` contains:
```
def test_a():
    pass

```
Steps to reproduce:
1. Click on refresh tests icon.
2. Once the test tree loads and `test_a` is present, click on the run test icon.

463,microsoft/vscode,Closing a view while dragging border makes the editor view unresponsive to mouse interaction,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Split view
2. While dragging the border between views, press Ctrl+W (closing the current view)

Now VSCode is completely unreactive to mouse interaction in the areas of the two views. Mouse interaction still works in the rest (the sidebar, terminal, top menu).

Curiously, closing more files or opening new files does not fix the issue. Splitting the view makes the new split responsive, but leaves the old split unfixed.

Version: 1.94.1
Commit: e10f2369d0d9614a452462f2e01cdc4aa9486296
Date: 2024-10-05T05:44:32.189Z
Electron: 30.5.1
ElectronBuildId: 10262041
Chromium: 124.0.6367.243

V8: 12.4.254.20-electron.0

- OS Version:
OS: Linux x64 5.15.0-122-generic
Xubuntu 20

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Type characters subjected to the “Unicode Highlight” rules.
2. Check that they are indeed highlighted (check or reset your relevant settings otherwise).
3. Hover over the highlighted characters with the mouse cursor.

**Expected result:** The explanations that there used to be there (I think?), giving the U+xxxx code of the character and what it can be mistaken with (if ambiguous) and “Adjust settings” options, etc.

**Actual result:** Nothing appears on hover, and no code actions are available.

Tried completely resetting my `settings.json` and disabling all extensions, but still nothing.
Tried in multiple filetypes (AsciiDoc, Shell script).

Maybe my memories about how this worked in the past are slightly mistaken, but still: in many old issues regarding Unicode highlight, I see people mentioning the possibility of hovering over them to get info and to “adjust settings”.

Other, unrelated hover-based features still seem OK.

Here’s a GIF in which I type and try to inspect a capital ?, a capital ?, and U+00a0?/?U+202f no-break spaces:

469,microsoft/vscode,Retrying opening a file with a custom editor always gives the same error,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

- Create a file that VSCode opens with a custom editor (I tried this with both the [NBT Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Misodee.vscode-nbt) extension and the [custom-editor-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/custom-editor-sample) extension)
- Open the file with the custom editor
- Close VSCode
- Rename the file
- Open VSCode again
- An error will be shown when loading the custom editor for the file, because the file could not be found
- Rename the file back to its original name
- Click the ""Try again"" button

Expected behaviour: The file should now be read by VSCode and opened with the custom editor, since it is available in the file system again

Actual behaviour: Opening the file always gives the same error that was given the first time VSCode tried to open it. This persists until the window is reloaded.

474,microsoft/vscode,mergetool conflict resolution auto applying combination as manual resolution,"
Type: <b>Bug</b>

Somewhat recently (I’d guess in the last 1-2 weeks – I’ve been doing a lot of history rewriting lately), VSCode’s mergetool started auto applying what I think are combinations as manual resolutions.

Data prep:
- Create a simple PowerShell script file (other files likely work – I just noticed the problem with PowerShell)
- In the PowerShell script, create a function and call that function
- Add and commit the new file. I used the git cli.
- In the PowerShell script, create a second function and call that function, adding the new function call after the first
- Add and commit the change
- Start an interactive rebase
- Edit the first commit
- In the PowerShell script, add a parameter to the first (only) function
- In the PowerShell script, use the new parameter in the first function
- Commit this change by amending it to the first commit
- Continue the rebase
- You should get a merge conflict

Minimal-ish example:

- Open VSCode as a mergetool (I have it specified in my global git config)
  - The first confict doesn’t make sense to me. There seems to be a conflict between the changes to the body in first function (LOCAL) and the entire second function (REMOTE).
  - The second conflict is between the second function (REMOTE) and the lack of a second function (LOCAL). This one makes sense to me.
  - The third conflict is between the new parameter to the first function (LOCAL) and the call to the second function (REMOTE). This one also makes sense to me.
- In the result pane, the first conflict shows as manually resolved when I haven’t made any changes.
- Clicking accept combination for the second conflict on the REMOTE side duplicates the second function.

To help with the example, here’s what the code should end up looking like (I used kdiff to resolve the merge conflicts):

```
function Invoke-TestWrite {
    param(
        [string]$testParam
    )

    Write-Output ""Hello, World!""
    Write-Output ""Hello, $testParam!""
}

function Invoke-SecondFunction{
    Read-Host -Prompt ""Hit enter to continue""
}

Invoke-TestWrite -testParam ""VSCode""

Invoke-SecondFunction
```

### Environment and OS details:
Application Name: Visual Studio Code 
OS: Windows 11 version 23H2 OS built: 22631.4169.
Version: 1.95.0-insider (user setup)
OS Build: 26100.1742
Version: 24H2

### Reproduction Steps:

1. Open Visual studio code insider editor.
2. Tab till copilot chat and ask copilot to generate Arg query for Indian region accounts
4. Press Alt + F2 to view accessible view.
5. Observed that the table format isn’t captured in the accessible view.

### Actual Result:
For some screen reader users, GitHub copilot’s accessible view is an integral tool and Table format is not communicated in that experience

### Expected Result:
This requires technical explorations to either introduce further formatting options in the accessible view. Also consider exploring allowing users to open content in a web view when they’ve requested HTML components.

### User Impact:
Users were unaware that a table could be generated and instead ended up asking for HTML code to put into a web view experience.

482,microsoft/vscode,'Open Editors' panel has unnecessary padding,"Hello VSCode friends,

The 'Open Editors' panel seems to have some extra unneeded padding on the left-hand side:

![CleanShot 2024-10-08 at 13 42 25@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aa4b697-b7e3-48c2-9bdc-bb772b005aa9)

It looks like some part of this is to provide a 'close' `x` button or an ""unsaved changes"" dot indicator, and some of the padding serves no purpose that I can see.  I have a pretty small laptop screen, so this extra space could be put to better use rendering longer file names.

Would it make sense to remove the extra padding, and change the `x` button to only appear on hover on the right-hand-side, like the behaviour in the SCM commits panel?

![CleanShot 2024-10-08 at 13 46 35@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb670e6a-c0a4-4a1a-bee3-14625ded2d87)

If you think this change makes sense, I would be happy to attempt changing it myself.  If you think this is too minor an issue to address, or shouldn't be fixed, by all means feel free to close.","['bug', 'open-editors', 'workbench-auxsidebar']",2024-10-08T20:48:51Z,1,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230838,UI/UX Bug

I am not sure if this is a VS Code bug or if it belongs to macOS, but I managed somehow to get the Selection menu drop-down to be *permanently* displayed (not entirely sure how, but I _think_ I was holding the mouse down while the File -> Open Recent menu was open, and then I tried to click an item but missed and hit an area outside any actual menu item).

The menu remains displayed in defiance of:

- Escape
- Hitting Selection top level menu several times to toggle it on/off
- Right-clicking VS Code icon in dock and do ""Show all windows""
- Clicking any of the items in the menu drop-down
- Opening/closing other top-level menus
- Cycling through windows with Cmd+Tab

Whenever VS Code is the foreground app, that menu is visible. I am going to do a sysdiagnose just in case. Please send me a request for specific files from the sysdiagnose if any of them will help you. I will keep it around for a few weeks.

486,microsoft/vscode,Custom HISTFILE not being honored,"> I believe this has been fixed. Pls let me know if you can still reproduce in a more recent version

_Originally posted by @meganrogge in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/7083#issuecomment-1373878654_

This issue is happening again with VSCode 1.94.0 and Remote - SSH v0.115.0 (I just installed this extension, don't know if it broke recently).

I have my HISTFILE defined in ~/.zshenv and when I connect to the machine via this extension, ~/.zsh_history gets recreated. (XDG_DATA_HOME is also defined in that file and it gets correctly used by the ""Server Install Path"" settings)

edit: Disabling shell integration in VSCode (as suggested in the original issue) seems to be a workaround for this issue.","['bug', 'terminal-shell-zsh']",2024-10-07T20:50:57Z,0,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/231313,Logical Bug

Killing it by PID unfreezes main vscode window.

Disabling all extensions (with `--diable-extensions` option on command line) didn't help.

Reverting VSCode snap to `38c31bc7` (which is 1.93.1) fixes things.","['bug', 'upstream', 'linux', 'upstream-issue-linked', 'chromium', 'native-file-dialog']",2024-10-07T06:10:27Z,15,0,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230679,Logical Bug

- VS Code Version: 1.94.0, [d78a74bcdfad14d5d3b1b782f87255d802b57511](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/d78a74bcdfad14d5d3b1b782f87255d802b57511)
- OS Version: Codespaces

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new codespace using a `.devcontainer.json` with `""workbench.startupEditor"": ""none""`.
1. Welcome tab still appears on first launch.

## Notes

Just wanted to re-surface https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/160635, which doesn't seem to have been fixed by https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/169674, at least in Codespaces. Per screenshots below, new codespaces still open for the first time with a Welcome tab, even with a minimalist `.devcontainer.json` containing only:

```json
{
  ""customizations"": {
    ""vscode"": {
      ""settings"": {
        ""workbench.startupEditor"": ""none""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I noticed that when you try to clone a repository with the Git extension via SSH and don't have public key authentication configured, VSCode doesn't ask for the remote user password.
Instead a not very meaningful error is shown:

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

I am aware, that the optimal solution would be to copy the public key to the remote and let SSH handle the authentication, or use HTTPS and the Git credential manager (which I have installed, but apparently it doesn't open up for SSH connections).
But there can be situations where none of this workarounds are viable.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. F1 
2. Git Clone
3. Enter something like this `ssh://user@example.com:4711/path/to/your/repo.git


Edit: The same error occurs for all other Git actions that involve the remote, like pushing, pulling, etc.","['bug', 'git']",2024-10-04T16:16:50Z,2,1,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/230506,Security Vulnerability
493,microsoft/vscode,Cannot set working directory when opening a new terminal,"Type: <b>Bug</b>

When using WSL in a multi-root workspace, the prompt appears to ask for the working directory, however the terminal opens in the home directory of the WSL VM.

Steps to replicate:
  1. Set up a WSL remote in VSCode
  2. Set up a multi-root workspace (e.g. workspace/folder1 and workspace/folder2)
  3. Click on Terminal -> New Terminal
  4. In the dropdown that appears, try to select a working directory

Expected result:
Terminal opens in the select working directory

Actual result:
Terminal opens in the home directory

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Make a multiline change to a file in a git repo
2. Goto `Source Control` view and click the file under `Changes`
3. Observe that the actions in between the diff editors are `-> Revert Block` and `+ Stage Block`
4. Now select a subset of the change and observe the actions change to `-> Revert Selection` and `+ Stage selection`
5. Click `+ Stage selection`
6. The entire change/block gets staged instead of just the selected lines

498,microsoft/vscode,Pasting a large amount of content in a json file will leave the cursor in the middle of the pasted content,"Repro:

1. Copy the content of this file: [content.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17232398/content.md)
2. Open settings.json
3. Move to the middle of the file, after some key
4. Paste, ?? the cursor is in the middle of the pasted content

Observation:

Undoing will remove the indentation and put the cursor at the end, so I suspect the cursor position is the original offset and not taking into account the inserted indentation. So maybe some race condition related to that?

499,microsoft/vscode,Editor: cannot Ctrl+click to goto definition in a link with a method name included,"For example in this case:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-bisect/blob/379f271eb92182890a1969e0ab55a79c1834576f/src/builds.ts#L297-L299

I cannot goto definition to the method call, it always opens the link.

Edit from @hediet:
```js
console.log(`https://example.com/${foobar()}`); // Do Ctrl+Click on foobar -> opens link and goes to definition!

function foobar() {
}
